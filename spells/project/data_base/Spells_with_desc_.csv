Boundless wealth of the oceans;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Group;Ritual;"5";+1 Touch, +2 Group;Creates 3,000 pounds of pearls, equivalent to over one million pearls about half an inch in diameter. These are remarkably large pearls, each one about a quarter of an ounce in weight. Good quality sea pearls usually sell for about three Mythic Pounds per ounce (Covenants, page 141). Each pearl is identical to its fellows, and is somehow marked by the sigil of the caster.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 117
Piercing lance of bone;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter;"Creates a sharpened lance of hardened animal bone in the caster’s hand; this weapon has the same statistics as a normal lance.";The Lion and The Lily – The Normandy Tribunal, 60
Repair cracks and tears;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"5";[one hide], +2 treated animal product [parchment] +1 Touch;This spell allows a magus to heal cracks and tears in the parchment and leather of a book. It is a comparatively expensive way to repair books, so it is only used when the covenant lacks skilled craftsmen, or on books of such historical significance that their owners prefer they are not repaired by human hands. For example, if one of the holographic diaries of Bonisagus is damaged, it is repaired in this way, rather than by having a scribe create a replacement page, because it preserves the handwriting of the Founder.;Covenants, 99
Shearing the unseen sheep;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;Creates a sheep’s fleece. Wool is the most common material for making clothing, but creating ready-made woolen garments is difficult with Hermetic Magic. As a consequence, Julia uses this spell to create the raw materials, and then rearranges them into clothing using Rego Craft Magic, such as Woolen Garments for the Human Form, below.;Magi of Hermes, 56
Soothe pains of the beast;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch;This spell looks much like a ritualistic “laying on of hands” seen in many churches. You kneel and press your hands to the wound while reciting a quiet incantation. The spell cures one Light Wound suffered by the animal.Asaron of Flambeau believes his mission in life is to repopulate the world so there will be more to kill, and thus spends seasons healing animals and people throughout Europe. In his version of this spell, a black patch in the shape of a tongue of fire is left wherethe wound was. A symbolic flame is seen in almost all of Asaron’s spells, making it his wizard’s sigil.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 117
True rest of the injured brute;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +3 Moon;The injured target gets a +9 bonus to all Recovery rolls made while the spell is in effect.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 117
Worm of the soil;Cr;An;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;Creates a beetle. All invertebrates are referred to as “worms” in Mythic Europe. This spell provided no breakthrough to Marcus’s research.;Magi of Hermes, 82
Flight perfected;Cr;An;"";"25";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;Creates a dove in the hands of the caster. The bird acts like a normal bird for the duration of the spell. This spell provided Marcus with no breakthrough.;Magi of Hermes, 83
Summoning the creeping death;Cr;An;Rego;"25";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +1 Rego requisite;Conjures an asp, which magically obeys the caster’s mental commands. Use the statistics for an adder from the Book of Mundane Beasts, except that an asp’s venom is much more deadly than an adder’s. The effects of asp venom are given on page 180 of Ars Magica Fifth Edition. The snake has no Might and hence no Magic Resistance of its own, but since it is a magically created creature, Magic Resistance does protect against its attack (use the caster’s Penetration Total).This spell is sometimes used by magi who follow the School of Sebastian, but other Flambeau magi tend to disdain it as an ignoble form of attack.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 34
Flight divorced;Cr;An;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part;Creates a pair of bird wings, joined at their base. The wings flap frantically in random flight for the duration of the spell, since they lack sense organs or a mind to guide them. If released in an enclosed space, the erratic flight of the wings provides sufficient distraction to impose a –3 penalty on all rolls requiring mental effort or concentration, and adds an extra botch die to all activities. The guideline used in this spell creates a living bird rather than an animal’s corpse, and the Part Target produces just the wings.This spell provided Marcus with a breakthrough in the first of the two seasons it took him to invent it.;Magi of Hermes, 83
Recruiting a tiny phalanx;Cr;An;Rego;"30";Touch,DSun;"";Group;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Group, +1 Rego requisite;This spell allows Alexander to create a swarm of scorpions. The swarm, combined, has the mass of a human being. The spell has a Rego requisite, which allows Alexander to command the swarm to do things other than chase beetles and run from larger creatures. In dangerous areas, he often casts two Circles of Beast Warding, one slightly larger than the other, around the area where his party is going to camp. He then pours scorpions into the ring this creates, and orders them to attack anyone else that crosses the ring, casting the spell multiple times if he feels it is necessary. This technique also has the advantage that if he botches the spell, and creates a swarm of enraged and uncontrollable scorpions, he need only wait safe behind his inner Circle of Beast Warding for them to disappear. Scorpion venom is painful, but individual stings are rarely fatal for healthy people. In areas where scorpions are common, the allergy that causes their sting to be fatal may be taken as a Minor Flaw. An attacking swarm of scorpions does +10 damage automatically each round, but this can be Soaked normally.;Magi of Hermes, 12
Strength extinguished;Cr;An;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part;Creates a bull’s heart. This spell provided Marcus with no breakthrough.;Magi of Hermes, 83
Sturdy mantle of the traveler;Cr;An;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 treated and processed;"Creates a gardcorps — a calf-length traveling robe with voluminous sleeves. The garment is formed of supple leather oiled to proof it against rain. A Finesse roll determines the quality of the gardcorps; an Ease Factor of 6 results in a waterproof robe of standard quality. If an Ease Factor of 9 is achieved the caster can determine the color of the leather and a specific regional style.";Magi of Hermes, 56
A pile of rotting beef;Cr;An;"";"35";Touch;Sun;Group;"";"10";+1 Touch +2 Sun +2 Group;Bees, which are vital for the production of most crops, are generated by the decay of the corpses of cows. Player characters who create too many bees before they have flowers must watch them starve, but players who have flowers, and no bees, must watch them wither. Fortunately, things generated by magically created animals persist even if the spell’s duration ends. Clever magi can simply strew their island with dead cows, using Sun duration spells like this one, and the bees which arise from these corpses are natural.This spell creates ten cow carcasses.Magi wanting to absolutely ensure they have bees can add a Perdo requisite, to make the corpses rot as they wish. Alternatively they can use spells like Growth of Creeping Things, bees being one of the insects created when destroying beef.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 63
Harmonic metamorphosis of the beast;Cr;An;Muto;"35";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"";"";"Special: Requires Hermetic Metamorphosis VirtueThis spell can only be successfully cast by those with the Hermetic Metamorphosis Virtue. It requires the immobilized body of the recipient animal, and the donor organ. If the donor derives from another animal, it too must be immobilized. During the casting of the spell, the caster removes the organ from the donor and grafts it to the recipient. The spell resizes the organ (if necessary) and joins up the blood supply and internal organs. The type of organs that can be transplanted are functional units of the animal — its head, pair of hind legs, tail, pair of hands, heart, and so forth. A replacement organ involves the removal of the recipient’s organ and putting the donor organ in its place. If the caster wishes he may take the recipient’s original organ and put it in the space left on the donor, but this requires two surgical rolls (see below), one for each animal. A transposed organ involves the recipient gaining an organ without removing something first; for example, giving it a pair of wings or a second head. The donor animal (if any) dies as a result of this type of surgery. Magical surgery of this type can be purely anatomical, or else confer a Virtue from the donor to the recipient. An anatomical change can grant the recipient a new ability (such as flight) or a Quality (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 40–43). A Virtue can be any General Virtue that derives from the body of the animal; such as Keen Vision, Long-Winded, or Tough. A donor who loses a Virtue due to this spell receives the Enfeebled Flaw if it survives the surgery. The ritual surgery performed as part of the magical actions of casting this spell needs to be performed accurately to ensure the success of the spell. This requires a Dexterity + Chirurgy roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If the organ is transposed rather than replaced, the Ease Factor has a +3 modifier. If the surgery grants a Virtue rather than an anatomical change, the Ease Factor has an additional +3 modifier. If the surgery roll fails then the animal dies soon after the casting of the spell. If the surgery roll botches, then the spell creates some dreadful monster instead. Example: Marcus wishes to swap the head of a lion and an eagle in his first step to creating a griffin. Eagles have the Keen Vision Virtue, so this is more than simple anatomical surgery. To successfully implant the eagle’s head on the lion’s body, his surgery roll has an Ease Factor of 12. He needs only a 9 to successfully implant the lion’s head on the eagle’s body, but the lion-headed eagle that results suffers from the Enfeebled Flaw. The spell compensates for the vast difference in size between the two heads. (Base 25, +1 Touch, +1 Muto requisite)";Magi of Hermes, 83
Strength renewed;Cr;An;"";"35";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part;"Creates a bull’s heart that continues to beat strongly for the duration of the spell. In the three seasons it took Marcus to learn this spell, he was lucky enough to get a breakthrough. However, the spell also has a minor flaw thanks to experimentation; the heart only beats in the light, and the strength of the pulse is dependent on the amount of light — in shadow the beat is thready and shallow, while in bright sunshine it is like a drum.";Magi of Hermes, 83
The balm of st francis;Cr;An;"";"35";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"25";+1 Touch, +1 size adjustment;This spell heals any animal disease, instantly easing the beast’s suffering. St Francis was a legendary healer of animals. This spell works on animals Size +2 or smaller.;Dies Irae, 102
Weaver’s trap of webs;Cr;An;"";"35";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"";"";"In casting this spell, you point and from this initial location, a huge net of spider webs grows, filling an area 5 paces by 5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports, the webs can hang vertically, forming a wall; otherwise they act like a net. When the webs are through growing after a few seconds, they are as thick as string and as strong as iron. Everyone caught in the area of the webs is immobilized. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll of 12+, or someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Contrary to widespread rumor, fire is ineffective against these webs. Webs may continue to trap victims in the future, as long as the spell lasts and they aren’t completely hacked apart. (Base level 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group (total mass of the spiderwebs is still less than ten basic Individuals, so no size adjustment))";Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 117
The wizard’s mount;Cr;An;"";"35";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 size;Creates a horse, which is normal in every way except that it is not disturbed by The Gift.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 117

A herd by morning;Cr;An;"";"45";Touch;Sun;Group;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 size;This spell brings the target group of up to a hundred base individual animals to full maturity over the course of the spell’s duration, which must begin as soon as the sun goes down.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 42
Venomous velites;Cr;An;Reg;"45";Sight;Sun;Group;"";"5";+3 Sight, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 extra effect from requisite.;Creates a swarm of a hundred poisonous scorpions. The Rego requisite allows the magus to command them to attack specific targets. If used in combination with spells like To Mark With Umbrage, the magus can command his scorpions to kill anyone on the battlefield not bearing his sigil. It is important for magi with weak Parmae Magicae to ensure they bear the mark.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 139
Curse of the ravenous swarm;Cr;An;Rego;"50";Touch;Moon;Group;Ritual;"5";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Group, +2 size, for a swarm weighing as much as one thousand pigs, +1 extra effect from requisite, ritual because it has a really major effect;Calls a swarm of locusts or other destructive insects upon an area, which destroys wild plant life and fields. When the spell’s duration ends, all the insects disappear, leaving nothing but the damage. The Rego requisite ensures that the insects only devastate the area desired by the caster.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 117
Twinning the tome;Cr;An;Intellego, Terram;"50";Touch;Mom;Group;Ritual;"5";"+1 Touch, +2 Group, +5 intricacy, +1 requisites; Boosted) Source: Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 10";"Special: Requires Boosted Magic or Mutantum MagicThis spell creates a nearly perfect copy of the binding and every page of a book you are touching, including illumination, creases, and damages. It requires an Intellego requisite to determine the shape and size of the pages, and a Terram requisite to create the ink. While an effective method of quickly copying the contents of a book, the vis cost is generally considered prohibitive; Milvi instead use it to recover valuable books that have been stolen or lost, or to copy ancient works that are too fragile to move. Thus, this version of the spell also allows for vis boosting, so that you can accommodate an Arcane Connection to the book without requiring you to learn another spell.";""
Conjuring the magical wolf;Cr;An;Mentem, Vim;"60";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"50";+1 Touch, +1 Mentem requisite;This ritual spell creates a magical wolf, as described in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 193. Once created, the wolf is not naturally friendly with the caster, and instantly reacts according to its own motivations.;Hermetic Projects, 126
Fashion the ancient worm;Cr;An;Corpus, Ignem, Mentem, Vim;"80";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"50";+1 Touch, +2 Size increase, +3 Corpus, Ignem, and Mentem requisites;This spell creates a dragon, which has the same statistics and powers as Stellatus (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 194). This dragon is not actually Stellatus, who is an individual, but the creature mirrors his powers and Abilities.;Hermetic Projects, 127
The breath of life returned;Cr;An;"";"80";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"75";+1 Touch;This spell returns a mundane animal of up to Size +1 to life.;Hermetic Projects, 130
Image of the beast;In;An;"";"5";Arc;Mom,;Ind;"";"1";+4 Arcane Connection;Gives you a hazy mental image of an animal you have an Arcane Connection to.Wounds caused by an animal are an Arcane Connection to that animal with a lifetime of a few hours. This spell can thus be used to find out what was responsible for an attack.All spells cast by Chavin of Tytalus can be recognized because they promote or advocate war or violence. In his version of this spell, the claws and teeth of the beast appear more dangerous.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 117
Sense the sleeping hound;In;An;"";"5";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice;This spell indicates to the caster if an animal within range is asleep. Care must be taken that the vocalization of this spell doesn’t wake the beast, which is good practice in determining how loudly a caster has to speak in specific spell-casting situations.;Apprentices, 47
Shiver of the lycanthrope;In;An;"";"10";Per;Conc;Touch;"";"4";+1 Concentration, +1 Touch;You feel a sudden shiver if you are touching a person or beast that is actually a lycanthrope.

A simple test for the completeness of books;In;An;Herbam;"15";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +1 requisite;This spell allows the magus to check the physical condition and history of a book. It also, through the Herbam requisite, allows the magus to test the quality of the plant-based inks used in its creation.;Covenants, 100
Numbering the flock;In;An;"";"20";Per;Mom;Sight;"";"4";+4 Sight Sense;The Numerologist instantly knows the number of animals she can see, and how many of each kind.The pattern of such numbers is considered to be far more significant than the details of the numbers.

Tongue of the fishes;In;An;"";"20";Eye;Conc;Ind;"";"10";+1 Eye, +1 Concentration;This spell allows Trajan to speak with any animal whose natural habitat is the river. Despite the spell name this includes animals other than fishes.;Hooks, 79
Books that scream in pain;In;An;"";"25";Touch;Mom;Room;"";"5";+1 Touch, +1 requisite, +2 Room;Req: HerbamThis spell allows the magus to check every book in a room for a physical or historical property. The name of the spell comes from the habit of an early librarian at Durenmar of making the books in the collection cry out if they were damaged, but the sigil of the caster determines the appearance of the spell’s signal. The spell’s Herbam requisite allows it to detect words in the books, provided they have a plant-based ink or binding agent, like gum arabic.determIne the locAtIon of the Absent Volume In(Cr)An(Im) 25R: Arc, D: Conc, T: IndReq: Imaginem, Creo (the latter optional)This spell allows the caster to determine the location of a missing book by having the magus’s sigil appear on a map. Library floor plans on tablets are often used in conjunction with this spell. With a Creo requisite, the magus can project an image of the book’s location on a mirror, and hand-held magic items using this variant are often employed in libraries that encourage visitors.(Based on The Inexorable Search, +1 requisite);Covenants, 100
Opening the tome of the animal’s mind;In;An;"";"25";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration;You touch the head of the animal in question and read its memories of the past day. The further the animal is from human, the harder it is to read its memories accurately. If you simply scan the beast’s memories, not looking for anything special, you get the memories the beast thinks are most important. If you are trying to get a specific fact, you need a Perception + Finesse stress roll of 6+, or 12+ if the fact is obscure. Since normal animals are sensitive to magic, they resist your touch and try to shy away from you both when the spell is cast and while the spell continues to function. This can be quite a problem with larger animals.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 118
Hunter’s sense;In;An;"";"30";Per;Sun;Hearing;"";"4";+2 Sun, +3 Hearing, +1 for shape and primary motivation) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 11;You sense the shapes and primary motivations of all animals above a certain size that you can hear, or could hear if they were making a noise. You decide the size threshold when you cast the spell, such as “all animals larger than a fox.” The “noise” of an animal’s shape is louder the larger it is, while the “noise” of its motivations increases depending on how intense the motivation is. A rabbit fleeing froma fox would sound fearful, very loudly. The fox’s motivation might be fairly quiet, especially if recent hunting had been good.;""
The eyes of every beast;In;An;"";"40";Touch;Conc.;Bound*;Ritual;"";"";This spell allows the magus to sense what the animals of the island are seeing. A magus who is not looking for a particular thing can simply ramble through the impressions of nearby animals. A magus seeking a particular thing in these perceptions must make a Perception + Awareness roll vs. an Ease Factor of 12 to find what he seeks.A level 45 version lasts a day.* Remember to add further magnitudes to increase Boundary size.

To see as others see;In;An;Rego;"40";Arc;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+4 Arcane Connection, +2 Sun, +1 extra effect from requisite.;This spell allows a magus to read the thoughts of an animal, and give it directions. This allows the magus to indirectly sense the animal’s location, using it as a spy. The magus’s perceptions are filtered through the mind of the animal, so they focus on those stimuli that the animal finds most vivid. Dogs find smell vivid, so the magus’s perceptions, when using a dog, will focus on odiferous substances. A magus reading the mind of a magpie finds that they fixate on reflective surfaces.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 139
The appropriate attire;Mu;An;"";"4";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;This spell slightly changes the color and cut of a leather jerkin, wool tunic, or fur cloak.

This change modifies Strength by +2, the range for each wound level increases by one, and Quickness falls by one. The new beast is of huge size, and looks much more impressive than its previous self.

A simple cloth doublet becomes the equivalent of armor with no Load and a +3 Soak bonus. Armor made of quilted material or any kind of leather improves its Protection by an additional +3. The magic does not make the armor better at absorbing shock, so this +3 bonus is the limit that can be bestowed without changing the material into something completely different.

In Lioness form this gives Lexora a Size of +3. Her Strength increases by +2 to +8, and her Quickness falls by 1 to 0. This changes her combat statistics in lioness form to Claws: Init +1, Attack +15, Defense +11, Damage +12, Bite: Init +1, Attack +13, Defense +8 Damage +11. A Size +3 lioness is a terrifying sight, and inspires awe and fear. Her fur appears to become tinted with gold, and in this form she is the size of a war horse.;Through the Aegis, 43

Remake the tailor’s craft;Mu;An;"";"15";Touch;Sun;Group;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group;"Transforms a set of clothing into different clothes. The substance and color must be preserved, but the shape and number of the garments can be altered. Thus a peasant’s woolen smock can become a woolen dress, wimple, and cloak. An Intelligence + Finesse roll determines the quality of the new set of clothes; an Ease Factor of 6 is sufficient for a simple change, although the Ease Factor is 3 points higher if the new clothes are dramatically different from the old. The spell assumes that the clothing is inthe main of animal origin — wool, felt, fur, leather, and silk — which is usually the case. A casting requisite of Herbam is needed to transform garments that are partly of plant origin, but items made solely of plant matter cannot be affected. Accouterments like wooden or metal fastenings remain unchanged.";Magi of Hermes, 91
The voice of the bjornaer magus;Mu;An;"";"15";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+2 Sun;This spell allows the caster to speak with a human voice when shapechanged into the form of an animal. The caster must be in animal form to cast this spell because it targets the vocal capacity of that form, and must be able to cast this spell with no words or gestures (usually a –15 penalty), but while under its influence, may use his own voice without penalty to spellcasting.;Houses of Hermes – Mystery Cults, 36

Fatal register;Mu;An;Rego, Intellego;"20";Per;Diam;Ind;"";"5";+1 Diameter, +2 requisites;This spell changes the book’s register, its bookmark ribbon, into a venomous serpent. Cobras are traditional. It is typically vested in a single-use charged object, activated when the book is stolen from a library.

These spells must be cast in animal form because they enhance the correspondences to the temperament of that form, whereas humans naturally have a more balanced temperament than animals. A Bjornaer magus may revert to human form after casting this spell and still retain its effects. It is not required that the animal form he takes take matches the temperament listed in the spell’s name; however, if the two do match, all bonuses granted by the spell are increased by one. Only one of these spells may be cast on the same character at any one time; they operate by influencing the bodily humors, and only one humor at a time may be influenced in this way.Sanguine: +1 Qik; +3 to all rolls to negate the natural fear the caster instills (as a wild animal with The Gift); temporarily acquires the Cheerful Personality Trait at +3 (or increases preexisting trait by 3)Choleric: +1 Dex; +3 to all rolls to follow a trail or find something deliberately hidden; temporarily acquires the Brave Personality Trait at +3 (or increases trait by 3)Melancholic: +1 Sta; +3 to all rolls to communicate across a language barrier, through empathy, via sign language, and so forth; temporarily acquires the Creative Personality Trait at +3 (or increases trait by 3)Phlegmatic: +1 Str; +3 to all rolls involving intuition and memory; temporarily acquires the Cool-Headed Personality Trait at +3 (or increases trait by 3)";Houses of Hermes – Mystery Cults, 36
Madder, woad, and weld;Mu;An;Herbam;"20";Touch;Month;Group;"";"1";+1 Touch, +3 Month, +2 Group, +1 requisite;The touched cloth — which can be wool, cotton, or linen — takes on a vivid hue as if dyed. Up to ten skeins of wool or 5 bolts of cloth can be dyed a single color chosen by the caster at the time of casting. When the spell’s duration expires, the cloth reverts to its natural undyed color. The spell is named after the three principle dyes employed in the thirteenth century — madder produces red, brown, and pink, woad makes blue, and weld results in yellow. By dyeing and then over-dyeing with a different color, a whole range of russets, maroons, greens, and oranges can be produced through mundane craft. However, a single casting of this spell can produce any possible hue.;Magi of Hermes, 56
The fur that turns blades;Mu;An;"";"20";Per;Sun;Ind(+1Size);"";"";"";This spell causes Lexora’s fur to appear dappled with golden patches, as if in bright sunlight, and it grows warm to the touch. She becomes far more resistant to weapons, teeth or claws, but her fur remains supple, giving +3 protection with no load penalty. She usually casts this before going hunting or if expecting trouble. (Base 5, +2 Sun, +1 Size);Through the Aegis, 43
Touch of the wild;Mu;An;"";"20";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +3 Moon;The target animal reverts to a feral form and throws off all its training and domestication, if any. In general the animal grows larger (although does not usually gain a point of Size), its hair grows longer and any horns, teeth and claws available as weapons become more vicious. The animal often loses its domestic coloration, becoming plain brown or brindled grey. Note that in Mythic Europe dogs are not domesticated wolves, and cows were not bred from the primeval aurochs — animals were created in the state in which they are found. Yet all are familiar with the process of a beast becoming feral if abandoned by man, and that is what this spell does. Marcus did not gain any breakthrough from this spell.;Magi of Hermes, 83
The beast remade;Mu;An;Corpus;"25";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, no addition for requisite+2 Voice, +2 Sun;Gives one land beast a human form, though its intellect remains the same.

Pests of a colossal size;Mu;An;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"4";+2 Sun. +2 Group, +2 Voice;While experimenting with Beast of Outlandish Size, an unforeseen side effect gave birth to this unusual, but peculiarly effective, spell. Pests of a Colossal Size causes the ordinary pests on the target (such as lice, fleas, ticks, etc.) to grow to an enormous size. Being covered in enormous and often hostile insects is disconcerting to say the least, as the pests themselves tend to revert to their basic fight or flight instincts.;Magi of Hermes, 28
Cloak of nessus;Mu;An;"";"35";Voice;Diam;Part;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 Part, +2 poison effect) Source: Magi of Hermes, 5;The targeted item of clothing partially converts into poison. The wearer suffers terrible agony as the poison touches his skin, and must make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to avoid taking a Light Wound. This Stamina roll must be repeated every round that the wearer is in contact with the robe, or until the Duration ends. The spell is named after the cloak dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus in Greek myth.Since creating a poison of this strength has a base level of 15 (if it were an Aquam effect), two magnitudes are added for this effect, although since the poison is of Animal origin an Aquam requisite is not needed.;""
Retreat as flying vermin;Mu;An;Corpus;"35";Voice;Sun;Circle;"";"20";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;This spell allows Alexander to turn a group of people, and their Animal-based equipment, into bats. It was designed to be used as a spell that would allow his grogs to rapidly retreat from danger, but the effect Alexander desired is slightly beyond his skill, so heneeds to draw a circle before the spell can be used. He plans to use it only in emergencies, because his grogs will lose those items of equipment that are not based on animal products when it is used, which includes their weapons. If forced to use this spell to flee a foe, Alexander plans to use Clouds of Obscuring Sand, and perhaps Ward Against the Sirocco first. He has a piece of bat leather in a small bag of trinkets he always carries, to use as a physical prop if this spell is cast.;Magi of Hermes, 13
Steed of vengeance;Mu;An;"";"35";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 size;Turns a horse into a ferocious magical mount. Its coat becomes a deep black and its eyes a fiery red, its teeth transform into fangs, its hooves become razor sharp, and it occasionally breathes steam from its mouth — the horse seems a creature from Hell itself. All Attack and Damage rolls get a +5 bonus. The horse tolerates a magus rider. When the spell wears off, the horse must make a Stamina stress roll of 9+ or die from shock.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 119
The griffin reborn;Mu;An;"";"35";Touch;Moon;Pair;Ritual;"25";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Pair+1 Touch, +2 Sun;"During the casting of this ritual spell, the caster removes the heads of two animals and reattaches them on each other’s bodies. The surgery causes no damage as long as the spell is cast correctly. With a Corpus casting requisite one of the targets can be a human, but at least one must be an animal. At the end of the duration, the caster can restore the heads to their owners if both are present, but if either target is absent then both die.Like Spirit of the Bull of Minos, this spell is the result of an insight into the ancient magics of the Minoan priests. The atypical Target of Pair is part of the non-Hermetic specification of this spell, and is treated as Target Group for the purposes of spell calculation. A Hermetic variant would use Target Part, but only affect a single creature.LEVEL 40 IcArus’ folly MuAn 40R: Touch, D: Sun, T: IndThe targeted animal is given a pair of wings. It does not immediately know how to fly, but just like a fledging bird it succeeds after the first few attempts. Unfortunately, a flaw introduced in the experimental process makes the duration of this spell unreliable; at the end of every hour of the duration, roll a simple die. If the result is equal or lower than the number of hours that have passed, the spell’s duration ends prematurely. After the precipitous death of the first few test subjects, Marcus named the spell after the legendary inventor of wings who himself plummeted to death after flying too close to the sun. As if in compensation for the flawed spell, the second season of invention resulted in a breakthrough.";Magi of Hermes, 84

Steed of vesuvius;Mu;An;Ignem;"45";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"25";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Size, free requisite;This spell magically transforms a horse so that he is able to gallop across molten lava as if it were a cobbled road. The horse also has no fear of the heat or fumes expelled by the lava, and he does not suffer from the heat of the lava or the toxicity of the fumes. The rider of the horse does not receive any protection from this spell. When the spell expires, the horse suffers a Long-Term Fatigue level.The requisite is free because it is part of the guideline and required for the effect.;Hermetic Projects, 15

You must touch both books when casting the spell, and because the spell is harnessed, you may end it at any time by concentrating. If the original book is damaged or altered, the contents of the duplicate will change to match it. Milvi occasionally use this spell to lend the same book to several different magi, or to communicate with each other over a long journey by linking a central book to a Redcap's travel journal. The spell also allows for vis boosting, so that you may copy a book using an Arcane Connection from wherever you happen to be.

An Herbam casting requisite is required for plant-based cloth.The garment, tapestry, or other item is disassembled carefully with all knots undone and stitching unpicked. The item is reduced to discrete piles of thread. A Dexterity + Finesse simple roll determines how orderly these piles are arranged and sorted.;Magi of Hermes, 99

The victim of this spell is left naked. If the victim is wearing leather armor (including metal- reinforced leather armor) then the armor falls into pieces. If the victim is wearing metal armor, the padding beneath the armor is affected. A character in this position suffers a –3 to all physical actions due to the shifting of his armor, and it grants only half of its Protection until the padding can be replaced. The clothes are capable of being repaired, so this is counted as damaging the garment rather than destroying it.;Magi of Hermes, 56
Blunt the viper’s fangs;Pe;An;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";Blunt the claws, teeth, talons, or other natural weapons of a beast. Only sharp weapons may be affected: this spell does not affect a weapon such as a horse’s hoof or a giant snake’s coils. The blunted weapon has its total damage (including Attack Advantage) reduced to half (round up). The beast may recover from the effect as if it were a Light Wound.

This allows library staff or Redcaps to easily carry a collection of books to a new location. This spell does not make the book chest itself weightless; that requires an Herbam requisite, and adds five levels to the spell’s difficulty. This spell is also used, enchanted into book cases, to make a library weigh less, which is important if the covenant has a growing library and no desire to replace the timber floors on the upper levels of its towers.";Covenants, 100

Casting this spell while intending to touch the animal is dangerous, as it may take several minutes to die, during which time it may thrash around wildly or strike the caster. For this reason, Milvi usually tether the spell to an arrow or javelin (though any sort of tether may be used), allowing them to cast it in secret from a safe distance. The beast will die after it is struck, and the increased duration ensures the caster has time tofire the arrow after casting the spell.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 102

Ward against the beasts of legend;Re;An;"";Gen;Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"";"";No magical beast whose Magic Might is equal to or less than the level can affect anyone within the Circle or, if it is within the Circle, affect those outside. When a magus is making this and most other wards, a common gesture employed is the Fig Sign. The magus balls his or her right hand into a fist, placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers. A magus traveling to Italy should be warned that this sign is a deadly insult in that country.(As ward guideline);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120

Binding the mundane codex;Re;An;"";"4";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Group;Req: Optional, VaryThis spell binds up to 1,000 prepared bifolds into books. Usually these bifolds have already been written upon, but magi may use this spell to create blank books if they wish. The spell fails if any of the necessary pieces of a codex are missing. Codices created with this spell are usually flap-books, since they lack wooden boards within their covers. Binding mundane materials into the book which are not derived from animals, like cover boards or registers, requires a spell with the appropriate requisite and an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 12. Some magi mold animal bones into plates, to serve instead of wood. This spell allows readers of the book to claim the +1 quality bonus for sound binding.;Covenants, 97

The wizard’s spindle;Re;An;"";"4";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Group;The caster converts up to 10 fleeces into wool. The wool is cleaned, carded, and spun in a single round. This requires a Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 12, since it replicates more than a week’s work completed in an instant. Failure to achieve this Ease Factor leaves the wool hopelessly tangled and useless.;Magi of Hermes, 57
Bind fast;Re;An;Herbam;"5";Voice;Mom;Group;"";"1";+2 Voice, +2 Group;The targets’ clothes seek out and bind themselves to the nearest other object, moving or not. If the members of a group are standing sufficiently close, this spell binds them together. The magic lasts just long enough for the clothes to bind themselves into knots, and then dissipates allowing the targets to free themselves by undoing or cutting the knotted cloth.While all of a target’s surface clothing will writhe and seek out something to bind to, there is no guarantee that all of it can. If the clothes are close-fitting, or there is not enough slack in the garment, the cloth will simply flail for a moment and then fall dormant. If there is sufficient cloth but there is nothing within its reach, the target may still become bound up as his clothes wrap and tie themselves around his limbs.Affected targets suffer a –3 penalty to all subsequent rolls for physical actions, but can free themselves by either dedicating a round to cutting or tearing the clothing, or by spending two rounds working to untie the knots.Storyguides may wish to give other options to particularly large, strong, or dexterous characters.Until members of the target group have freed themselves, successive castings of this spell have no further effect.;Magi of Hermes, 100
Disguise of the putrid aroma;Re;An;"";"5";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"2";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;The target takes no interest in you as long as you continue to concentrate, and do not threaten it. A carnivore treats you as if you were simply something it does not eat. It retains normal interest, however, in anyone else nearby.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120
Dressing the human form in wool;Re;An;"";"5";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";"This spell crafts a single woolen garment from either raw fleeces or from spun wool. This spell is suitable for producing a cotte, cyclas, ganache, bliaut, cappa, or chausses (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert). A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 12 if raw fleece is employed, or 9 if the base material is spun wool. The clothes produced are of standard quality; increase the Ease Factor for particularly fine or complex craft. If the Finesse roll fails, the caster is left with a useless mess of wool. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items, later). She does not have a spell that directly creates mundane clothing of wool due to the difficulty (it would be a similar spell to Sturdy Mantle of the Traveler, earlier). Instead, it is much easier to simply create fleeces (see Shearing the Unseen Flock, later) and then craft them into clothing with this spell. This spell employs the Level 3 Rego Animal guideline on page 50 of Covenants: “treat and process items made of animal products.” (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 complexity)";Magi of Hermes, 57

The even hand of the determined weaver;Re;An;Creo;"5";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"1";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 for size, +1 for Creo requisite) Source: Magi of Hermes, 10;Like The Weaver’s Subtle Art (below), this spell makes a lasting change to a tapestry or other item made from cloth (whether made from wool, cotton, silk, or linen).Any geometric shape or regular line in or on the item, or even the shape of the item itself, can be made even and precise. The Creo requisite ensures that the lines and shapes affected by this spell are perfect examples of their type.This spell is used to enhance items, especially when making Excellent-quality wares, or Items of Quality as per the Verditius House Mystery detailed in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 124. The application of this spell alone is not enough to raise the true quality of an item (it cannot be made more hardy or more richly colored, for instance), but it is enough to aid spells that require certain mathematical resonances.The individual changes made by the spell may stand out and draw the eye of those interested in the piece. Those looking at the work should make a Perception + Awareness + simple die roll against an Ease Factor of 9. On a success they notice the precision of the affected areas. Those who have the ability may substitute their Weaver craft ability for Awareness when making the check.A Herbam casting requisite is required for tapestries that include plant-based cloth or yarn.;""
The treacherous cloak;Re;An;"";"5";Sight;Conc;Ind;"";"1";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration;This spell uses a target’s clothes against him, twisting them intocords that then strangle the target for as long as the caster keeps concentrating.Using the deprivation rules in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 180, the target must make a Stamina check every 5 rounds. Additionally, the target can attempt a Strength + Athletics stress roll against the caster’s Dexterity + Finesse Simple roll in order to break the grip of the clothes. If the character is being helped, use the highest Strength + Athletics score and add 1 for each other person helping. The target can attempt a Brave Personality Trait roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to perform an action other than attempting to free himself from the grip of his own clothes.The caster must, as usual, succeed in Concentration rolls each round.;Magi of Hermes, 100
The weaver’s subtle art;Re;An;"";"5";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"1";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 for size, +1 for Finesse;This spell allows the caster to make minor alterations to a finished tapestry or embroidered item, such as changing a subject’s pose, improving a likeness, or rewording an embroidered phrase. The change is minor in relation to the whole, never making up more than a fraction of the item, but as this spell can act on large tapestries, the individual change may itself be quite large. The change retains the original character of the work, so the intrinsic workmanship cannot, in itself, be improved through this spell.The version known to Petalichus was handed down through generations of his confraternity. Casters who know this version may use their Weaver craft ability in place of Finesse when determining the quality of the effect. Magi who invent this spell, or learn it from another source, use Finesse as normal.A Herbam casting requisite is required for tapestries using plant- based thread.;Magi of Hermes, 101
A day’s worth of spinning;Re;An;"";"10";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Group;One of the first spells taught to Petalichus by his mater, this spell cleans, cards, and spins a whole fleece, or a bale of cotton or flax, into thread in a matter of moments. If dye is available when the spell is cast, the thread can be dyed as the caster directs. A Herbam casting requisite is required for plant-based cloth.This is an Average task for a mundane spinner, so the caster must make a Perception + Finesse (precision) + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 12 (Craft Ease Factor 9 + 3 for using Craft Magic). Failing the roll results in a badly spun fleece, probably with flecks of dirt still clinging to the thread. A botched roll ruins the fleece outright, though this may not be immediately apparent.See Covenants, page 49 for more on Rego Craft Magic.;Magi of Hermes, 100
A day’s worth of weaving;Re;An;"";"10";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"";"";This spell is exceptionally good at making simple cloth, but casters may find it difficult to create cloth of any great quality or highly patterned tapestries. The table below lists the base Ease Factors for weaving bolts of cloth in a single casting. Treat each bolt of cloth as being two paces in length by one pace wide. Successive castingscan extend the current bolt of cloth rather than creating a new item. Members of Petalichus’ lineage have traditionally used this spell in practicing their Finesse.The caster makes a Perception + Finesse (precision) + stress die and compares the result against the table below.Cloth Bolt’s Quality Level Craft Magic Ease Factor Shoddy Trivial 6 Standard Simple 9 Superior Average 15 Excellent Hard 18It is a harder task to create patterned cloth. A simple repeating pattern adds +3 to the Ease Factor, while an image or words woven into the cloth adds +6.See City & Guild, page 67 for more on item quality. A Herbam casting requisite is required for work involving cotton or linen. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Group);Magi of Hermes, 100
A simple charm for the recovery of misfiled books;Re;An;"";"10";Arc;Conc;Ind;"";"1";+4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration;This spell makes a misplaced book fly swiftly to rest on its lectern, in an open bookcase, or to the hand of the caster. The spell requires an Arcane Connection to the book, which is usually the library catalog, although the book’s voucher can serve equally well. The book moves about as quickly as a running man, and falls to the ground if the caster’s concentration lapses before it arrives. This spell cannot cause books to pass through solid objects, so the book must have a clear path to the magus for the spell to work. Stolen books are usually kept in a chest, or behind a closed door, to prevent this spell’s use.;Covenants, 100
Hide to parchment;Re;An;"";"10";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Group;This spell stretches, shaves, and dries a stack of animal hides, as if a percamenarius had worked on them. Stretching makes hide flexible instead of leathery, while shaving makes it smooth enough for writing and thin enough for binding. Drying prevents mold from forming on the vellum, but if excessive makes it brittle.A Perception + Finesse roll is treated as a Craft: Percamenarius roll to determine the quality of the vellum created.;Covenants, 96
Reorder the contents of the armarius;Re;An;Intellego, Mentem (the latter optional, raises level to 15);"10";Touch;Mom;Room;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Room, +1 requisite, +1 versatility;This spell places books in a book chest or closet into a sequence. Sample sequences include the Art or Ability the books concern, the authors’ names, size through any dimension, the color of the covers, the binding material, the newness of the books, and their opening sentences. If the books are marked with acquisition or shelf location numbers, then those may also guide the sequence. With a Mentem requisite the magus can shelve books based on whether he has read them or not, how much he liked the books while reading them, how he feels about the authors, or his emotional attachment to the people who gave him the books. Books in chained libraries need to be taken off their rails for this spell to be used.;Covenants, 100
Soothe the ferocious bear;Re;An;"";"10";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice;Calms an animal until it is threatened or aroused again. You must speak soothingly or musically to it, and something as simple as approaching it may arouse it again.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120
A spell to milk cattle;Re;An;"";"15";Touch;Conc;Group;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;"While you wait, the cows are magically milked without further handling, transferring their milk into nearby milkpails. The magus’s Perception + Finesse roll substitutes for an Animal Handling roll by a competent farmer; the spell gathers the milk, but if the roll is failed, the cattle may be spooked.Milking cattle is normally Simple (3) if the cattle are accustomed to the process and the milking hand, so the basic Finesse Ease Factor is at least 6, higher if anything disturbs the cows. Cows are initially be disconcerted at being milked by invisible hands, and need soothing (The Gentle Herd is ideal for this task). Unless magically calmed, the Finesse roll is Very Hard (15+) the first time cows are milked by magic, but this Ease Factor reducing over time and successful milking to 12, then 9, until the cows become accustomed to the process (6).";Covenants, 51
Binding the hermetic codex;Re;An;"";"15";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +3 complexity;Req: VaryA variant of Binding the Mundane Codex, this spell allows magi to incorporate resonant materials into their bindings. Binding a book with resonant materials is extremely difficult and requires an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 12 + 3 per resonant material, to a maximum of three materials. This spell allows readers of the book to claim the +1 quality bonus for sound binding.;Covenants, 97
Panic of the elephant’s mouse;Re;An;"";"15";Eye;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +1 Concentration;Makes an animal afraid of the target by preying upon its instinctive fears, causing it to attempt escape by the quickest, most feasible means possible. The animal may make a Size stress roll of 9+ to resist. The title refers to the elephant’s legendary fear of mice, but note that this spell cannot actually affect elephants, as they are too large.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120
Soothing voice of the stableman;Re;An;"";"15";Voice;Sun,;Ind;"";"2";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 size;This spell implants the suggestion that the caster is a safe and helpful friend into the mind of the target animal. The spell maintains this suggestion in the mind of the animal for the duration of the spell,regardless of the actions of the caster. This spell can not remove the sense of unease that an animal will feel when exposed to a Gifted character, but an animal of bestial intelligence will not be able to associate its unease with the caster.Horses subject to this spell can be used as mounts by magi who do not have the Gentle Gift, but the uneasiness of such mounts makes them skittish and fearful. In situations where the mood of the animal is important, the Ease Factor of appropriate rolls should be 3 higher than normal and subject to one or more additional botch dice.The effect of the Blatant Gift is sufficiently strong to make animals frenzied when they are both subject to this spell and exposed to a Blatantly Gifted caster. Animals that are Warped from long-term exposure to this spell often become belligerent and frightened all of the time.;Magi of Hermes, 65

Fury of the charging bull;Re;An;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Size;The target animal (which may be as large as Size +3) becomes angry and must make a Personality roll using a trait such as Angry or Fierce (or perhaps others, at the storyguide’s discretion). If the roll exceeds an Ease Factor of 9, the animal flies into a rage. Once the animal is aroused, it calms down normally. Docile animals such as ewes or oxen calm down almost immediately, while especially aggressive animals like boars or wolves may go on a rampage lasting several minutes. While angry, the animal tries to drive away people or other animals that are nearby, and may attack those who do not flee from it.Some magi who follow the School of Vilano use this spell to make animals attack their enemies. In practice, its effects are unpredictable - the animal is just as likely to attack a bystander as the intended target, and there is nothing to prevent it from turning on the caster!;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 34
Plague of frogs;Re;An;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Group;"A swarm of frogs spontaneously generates in a pool of water touched by the caster. A pool five paces across and two paces deep can produce one thousand frogs; for every ten-fold increase in volume, ten times as many frogs are produced up to a maximumof 20,000 (which is a mass of frogs equal to that of ten pigs). Likewise, a smaller pool produces fewer frogs: a pool one tenth the size produces a hundred frogs, and one that is a hundredth of the size (about one pace across and half a pace deep) spawns just 10 frogs. The water in the pool is not diminished by this spell.";Art & Academe, 30
The command of every beast;Re;An;"";"20";Touch;Conc.;Bound*;Ritual;"";"";This spell allows the magus to give a command to every beast on the island.

Woolen steed of araby;Re;An;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 unsupported surface, +1 for any direction, +2 for increased speed;"Imbues a woolen rug or animal pelt with the power of flight. A person sitting on the rug is lifted along with it, and the caster may make Intelligence + Finesse rolls to change direction or speed.The Ease Factor is related to current speed — Ease Factor 6 for walking pace, Ease Factor 12 at moderate speed, Ease Factor 15 at maximum speed of forty miles an hour. (Note that these Ease Factors are higher than for Mercury’s Winged Sandals due to the increased difficulty of moving an object rather than oneself directly). The rug can only support the caster and his clothes; he can have no more than one point of Encumbrance or else the spell cannot lift him. The passenger is not protected from falling off the flying rug, so impressive aerial maneuvers are not recommended, nor is flying through strong winds.The extra magnitudes have been added to this spell by analogy with the Rego Corpus guidelines.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 111

The animal must be Size +4 or less.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120
Mastering the unruly beast;Re;An;"";"25";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration;You can make an animal perform any act it is capable of. You can only issue new commands while touching the animal, but the animal will carry them out without requiring constant contact. Further, the animal will allow you to touch it throughout the duration of the spell. It is difficult to maintain control of particularly stubborn or fierce animals, such as mules or boars — creatures with appropriate Personality Traits may roll against an Ease Factor of 12+ each round.When Chavin of Tytalus casts this spell, the creature acts surly and unfriendly while going about its tasks, even when Chavin doesn’t specifically tell it to act that way.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120
Commanding the harnessed beast;Re;An;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;You implant a complicated command into an animal, which it carries out to the best of its abilities. The command must involve completing a certain task, such as finding a certain person. Vagueorders, like “protect me,” do not work. If the animal does not complete the task before the end of the spell approaches, it becomes desperately ferocious, especially at night.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 120

This spell only affects clothes of wool, leather, and fur. The constricting clothing makes it very hard for the wearer to breathe, and he risks strangulation; causing him to make a Deprivation roll (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, pages 180–181) every 30 seconds (or 5 combat rounds). Since Rego Animal lacks a guideline for making an animal product move with a purpose, the Rego Herbam guidelines have been used as an analogy.";Magi of Hermes, 57
Summon the eldritch bond;Re;An;"";"35";Voice;Sun;Ind.;"";"15";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;"A fine preparation to a Wizard’s War, this spell commands a biting insect, such as a mosquito or flea, to bite a specific target and then return. A canny magus can then harvest the blood and its Arcane Connection from the insect. Of course, this needs to be cast fairly close to the target for the insect to have a chance of catching him. However, combining this spell with Pests of a Colossal Size greatly extends its effective range, as well as the intimidation factor. It does rather reduce its subtlety, however; a magus who would ignore a normal mosquito is unlikely to do the same for a giant one.";Magi of Hermes, 28

Voice of the king;Re;An;"";"40";Voice;Diam;Group;"";"15";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 Group;This spell works much as Commanding the Harnessed Beast (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 120), with the exception that it is designed exclusively to work on whole swarms of bees (a swarm of bees weighs less than a pig, so no size adjustment is necessary). Bees are fairly intelligent as insects go, but they’re still just insects, so vague or overly complex commands are not likely to be very effective. The bees will probably still attempt the task even if they don’t understand it. Note that usurping the king bee’s authority can anger the hive once the spell wears off.;Magi of Hermes, 38
Bring the herd to market;Re;An;"";"45";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +4 transport seven leagues) Source: Transforming Mythic Europe, 10;Instantly transports a Group of standard Individuals up to seven leagues, usually to a location known to the caster. This is often sufficient to transfer a flock from its pasture to market. This spell can affect up to two hundred chickens (Size –3), fifty sheep (Size –1), ten ponies (Size +1), or five horses (Size +2).;""
The unfaithful favor;Re;An;"";"45";Touch;Su;Ind;"";"25";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 commands in addition to transport) Source: Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 13;This spell commands a silk handkerchief to strangle an enemy for whom the magus has an Arcane Connection. The handkerchief appears near the victim and swiftly wraps itself about their throat. They take damage according to the rules in Ars Magica Fifth Edition until death or the destruction of the handkerchief. Conscious victims can often avoid the handkerchief, so this spell is usually cast at night. After the victim dies, the handkerchief hides itself in their bedding, or up their sleeve.;""
Pages of the unfinished story;Re;An;Intellego;"45";Touch;Mom;Str;"";"20";+1 Touch, +3 Structure, +1 Intellego Requisite;This spell requires a piece of parchment written on by a character, such as a page of Lab Text or part of a tractatus. The caster holds the piece of parchment against the wall of a structure (such as a tower), and all pages of parchment written on by the same author, in the last week, within the tower instantly transport into the caster’s hand.Most authors would immediately notice that their work has been stolen when they return to their writing table. If more than two weeks’ writing is stolen through successive castings of this spell, any Laboratory work on which the author is working will be interrupted.This spell uses the Rego Corpus guideline to instantly transport a body, by analogy, to transport animal products.Note that who wrote the text on a piece of parchment is a part of the history and origins of an animal product (the parchment), which can be detected with an Intellego Animal effect. This is why an Intellego requisite is required.This spell only gathers material written by the same character who wrote the sample. Thus, if the sample piece was in fact written by ascribe, instead of by the expected magus, then this spell will collect work written by the scribe.An equivalent Herbam spell could be used to gather text written on paper or papyrus, but parchment (which is made from animal hide) is the most common form of writing surface used in the Order of Hermes.The Art of Aquam;Hermetic Projects, 90
Hurling the droplet of lye;Cr;Aq;"";"3";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"1";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter;This spell produces a drop of lye that can burn a coin-sized hole in leather cloth or in parchment. If hurled at a living target, the corrosive substance can cause +1 Damage.;Apprentices, 46
Footsteps of slippery oil;Cr;Aq;"";"5";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter;From each of the next ten footsteps the caster of this spell takes, nonflammable grease spreads out, leaving a slick area 10 paces wide. Dexterity stress rolls are required to remain upright whenever a character on the oil does something more challenging than walking. A roll of 6+ is needed for the average maneuver, with rolls of up to 15+ needed to (for example) make a right turn at full speed on a smooth, greased surface. The duration is the length of time that the oil lasts.This spell was invented by a rather goodnatured magus, and the gestures associated with the most common variations of the spell are as comical as the effects themselves. You can stand first on one leg, and then the other, vigorously rubbing the bottom of each upturned foot, as if spreading on a salve.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 121
Dagger of ice;Cr;Aq;Rego;"10";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Rego requisite;Creates a foot-long, sharp icicle and hurls it at a target.

After impact, the icicle shatters to tiny fragments, which promptly disappear.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 35
Creeping oil;Cr;Aq;"";"15";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;Saturates a porous material with flammable oil. When casting this spell, you make a flicking motion with your index finger and thumb, as if propelling something at the target. A dot of oil appears on the target after the spell is finished, and slowly spreads over the target, saturating enough cloth to cover a person. If used on a person’s clothes and ignited, the oil does +12 damage the first round, +6 the second, and +0 the third.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 121
Lungs of drowning;Cr;Aq;Corpus;"20";Touch;Diam;Part;"";"4";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +1 Part, +1 Corpus requisite) Source: Hermetic Projects, 8;This spell fills the target’s lungs with water, causing him to experience the sensation of drowning. The character begins to suffer deprivation due to lack of air (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 180), but as the spell only lasts for Diameter duration (two minutes), the character is unlikely to die unless the spell is repeatedly cast on him.;""

The target of this gusher of water takes +10 damage and must make a Strength + Size stress roll of 9+ or be sent flying back.Marbaid of Flambeau’s wizard’s sigil is connected to his obsession with blood. In his version of the spell the target is hit by a gush of blood, and the stains do not go away until sunrise/ sunset. This does not require a requisite, as it is a purely cosmetic effect.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 121
Alchemist’s revenge;Cr;Aq;"";"25";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+2 Voice;Splashes a target with acid, inflicting +15 damage if it penetrates Magic Resistance. At the storyguide’s option, the acid may damage the target’s equipment.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 35
Rarefy the crude water;Cr;Aq;"";"30";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"";"";"This ritual spell rarefies a base amount of water (up to a pool of 5 paces diameter and 2 paces deep) to bring a water elemental into existence. At its maximum size, the elemental has a Might of 15 and a Size of 0, but smaller bodies of water will yield smaller elementals. The character guides given later in the chapter describe typical elementals created by this spell. For larger (and thus more powerful) elementals, this spell must be invented with a Size modifier to the target, with each application of the modifier giving +3 Size. Since Size determines Might (see later), 1 extra size magnitude gives an elemental a Might of 20 (Size +3), 2 a Might of 25 (Size +6), etc. This spell doesn’t need to penetrate the Might of the elemental instantiated; until the completion of the spell, the elemental doesn’t exist.(base 25, +1 Touch)";Realms of Power – Magic, 133
Wizard’s flood;Cr;Aq;"";"35";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +7 size;This ritual, when cast in a river, causes it to rapidly rise and burst its banks. This floods the terrain about half a mile from either bank, for a length of about 20 miles, to a depth of two paces. The area inundated depends on the local geography (cliffs, gorges and dams may direct the flow, for example). The flood waters are natural, cannot be resisted by Magic Resistance, and may take days to recede, evaporate, and drain. The flood drowns people and animals, ruins crops, and washes away most wooden structures (and ruins the lower level of stone ones). This ritual is Trajan’s master work. He is well known for it in the Rhine.;Hooks, 79

The results of this spell are generally quite impressive. As the stream overflows its original bed, it becomes a raging torrent, sucking in everything near it. Damage from the spell can last for many years.As long as you concentrate, the stream remains at flood levels. Anyone caught near the stream when it floods is struck by the rush of water (+10 damage), caught up in the flood, and dragged along. Every round, a victim makes a Strength + Swim stress roll. A roll of 9+ means the character escapes the flood. Otherwise, the character loses one Fatigue level and takes +5 damage. Any who fall unconscious drown. This roll is repeated until the character either escapes the flood or dies. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +3 size, so that the whole stream floods);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 121

Once you cast the spell, you can hear the water while you concentrate. Following the sound eventually brings you to the water, but you must make simple Perception rolls of 6+ to follow the sound accurately (roll once per day for long journeys).

Maximum range for scrying is 500 miles; the range of the spell is the range to the pool when the spell is cast. This ritual is not entirely of Hermetic magic, and does not conform to the normal InAq guidelines. It is an old Mercurian ritual that has become known throughout the Order, and which appears to use one body of water as an Arcane Connection to any other body of water.

When on expedition, Alexander often carries several of these teeth. They are not a perfect solution to water shortage, because Alexander, while young, cannot dispel this effect, so the water only becomes available when the spell expires.

If Alexander bites something hollow, so that his poison is injected into it, the poison does not disappear when he returns to human form.

Closing the earth’s gate;Pe;Aq;"";"25";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"20";+1 Touch;Dries a single spring, so that it never flows again. This spell targets the spring, not the water in it at a particular time, so the spring does not start to flow again later.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 123
Curse of the desert;Pe;Aq;"";"25";Voice;Mom;Part;"";"";"";Removes virtually all the fluid from the target’s body, doing +15 damage, which armor does not protect against.

The becalmed harbor;Pe;Aq;"";"55";Touch;Moon;Part;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +1 Part, +3 Size;This project removes the naturally-occurring aether from within the waters of a harbor or bay. In doing so, the aether in the heavens is unable to influence the motion of the waters and all tides stop throughout the Moon Duration. The ocean neither rises nor falls as before, but rather retains the level at the point it occupies when the ritual concludes.GENERAL;Dies Irae, 41

The copyist’s puissant quill;Re;Aq;"";"5";Voice;Mom;Group;"";"1";+2 Voice, +2 Group;"This craft magic spell causes prepared ink to form words and images on a page. The ink is overlaid on guidelines already present on the page, such as chalk or charcoal sketches left by a copyist, or the result of a spell such as The First Furrow Guides the Second. The Group Target permits multiple colors of ink to be employed. The spell does not distinguish between writing and illustrations, copying both with equal skill. The caster must make an Intelligence + Finesse roll to determine the accuracy of the spell’s copying. The Ease Factor is 9 for an easy piece of copying; for example, one color and no illustrations, typical of a book with a Quality of 6 or less. The Ease Factor is higher for more complex or detailed works typical of higher Quality; for a Quality of 7 to 9 the copying Ease Factor is 12, and for a Quality of 10 or more the Ease Factor is 15. If this roll fails, then the ink fails to form letters and simply makes a mess. A botch indicates that the text looks fine but is actually nonsensical, a flaw only discovered when the text is read for the first time; however, characters will not often be rolling stress die for this Finesse roll.Variants of this spell with higher Duration allow a magus to use this spell to make patterns on the page that correspond to the caster’s words.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 100
Break the oncoming wave;Re;Aq;"";"10";Per;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+1 Concentration, ward, so the target is the warded Individual, not the water;Breaks all waves and torrents of water (including magical ones) as they come within 10 paces of you. The water either crashes to the ground or flows around you in a truly impressive display.In Ferramentum of Verditius’s version of this spell, the water breaks at precisely 10 paces, leaving a very clean line showing where the waves stopped.

Exactly to scale;Re;Aq;Mentem;"10";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 for highly unnatural control;This spell, designed by a Tremere Artificer with broader imagination than vocabulary, is used to draw precise pictures of a magus’s ideas. The inventor used this spell to draft technical diagrams, but many of his sodales use it for mapmaking. It requires the presence of a pot of ink and a drawing surface, because the spell creates permanent images using mundane materials.The magus requires an Intelligence + Finesse roll of 9+ for the diagram to be legible.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 139

This spell does not allow a magus to write faster than the core rules permit, but does allow impaired magi to write when they would otherwise require a notary. A Finesse roll makes the writing particularly precise and neat, which is usually unimportant.;""

Swallowed by the mist;Re;Aq;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Part;"";"3";+ 2 Voice, +1 Part, +2 Size;This spell turns the targeted section of water to mist, causing swimmers and ships alike to plummet to the ground while the mist rises up, and then the sea crashes down around them. Successfully targeting this attack requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (6 if the target is smaller than a rowboat, as there is more leeway in the transformed area). Observers of this spell will often just see a large cloud of mist rise around the target, and the ship will simply be gone.;Magi of Hermes, 75
Ward against water;Re;Aq;"";"20";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;No water may enter or leave the protected circle. Characters who are wearing wet clothing or perspiring are slowed when entering or leaving a protected area as the excess liquid is stripped from their bodies and possessions. Hermanus cast this ward using forceless casting (Houses of Hermes: True Lineages page 72), so the ward surrounding his laboratory complex has a Penetration of zero, allowing liquids carried by magi and creatures with Magic Resistance to pass through unimpeded.;Legends of Hermes, 108
Flame tongue;Re;Aq;Ignem;"25";Voice;Mom;Part;"";"10";+2 Voice, +1 Size;This spell causes a glutinous glob of lava (from a lake or river of magma) to leap out and hit something. The volume of lava moved is about 2 cubic feet, and it can be moved to hit any location within Voice range. Whatever the lava hits takes between +15 and +60 damage, depending on how much of it is covered by the lava. The lava sticks to whatever it hits and continues to inflict damage each round. It takes several days for the lava to cool naturally.The heat of the lava is also sufficient to ignite anything flammable that it hits.Flame Tongue is an Aimed spell, with a +6 bonus to hit due to the size of the volume of lava.If the caster tries to totally immerse a person with the lava projectile, there is a –6 penalty to the Aiming Roll (effectively canceling the +6 size bonus). There is no penalty to the Aiming Roll if the objective is to merely splash someone. In some circumstances, the storyguide may decide that a missed attack to immerse a character results in a splash.;Hermetic Projects, 16
Bridge of frost;Re;Aq;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Part;"";"";"";Causes a thick layer of frost (firm enough to walk on) to form on the surface of a body of water. The frost can take any shape up to fifteen paces in any direction.In Cralian of Tremere’s version of this spell, the frost is so crystal clear that it can hardly be seen.

Waves of drowning and smashing;Re;Aq;"";"30";Sight;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+3 Sight, +1 size;Raises a wave 5 feet high and 30 paces wide, which can submerge swimmers, overturn rowboats, and damage sailing ships. It starts as a small, curved wave and grows for the first 10 paces, at which point it reaches maximum size.

Pull of the watery grave;Re;Aq;"";"35";Sight;Conc;Ind;"";"10";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +1 size;Creates a strong undertow that pulls any object smaller than a rowboat 25 fathoms (150 feet) into the depths. Each of those caught in the undercurrent must make 9+ on a Strength + Swim stress roll to avoid being dragged down. A roll is made each round that the spell is maintained.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 124
Sail with the tide;Re;Aq;"";"35";Voice;Conc;Part;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 Part, +3 size;Ships must usually wait for the tide before they leave port. Waters dangerous at low tide become navigable at high tide, allowing laden ships to leave port safely. This means that there are limited times in the day that ships can enter and leave port.This spell draws a magical high tide to an area chosen by the caster, which is maintained for as long as the caster concentrates. The swell is enough to float a large ship and the caster is able to move the tide in relation to the ship.The effect Duration is Concentration, which means the caster may need to maintain concentration for some time, likely an hour or two.;Hermetic Projects, 74
Summon the airy spirit of water;Re;Aq;"";"35";Arc;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";Summons the target airy spirit associated with Aquam into the caster’s presence. There is nothing to compel the spirit to stay once summoned.(Base: 15, +4 Arcane Connection);Through the Aegis, 105

It causes a simple die + 15 damage to anyone it hits (no Attack roll necessary). In addition, those struck must make a Quickness stress roll of 6+ to avoid being sucked up by the waterspout. Those who fail are helplessly pulled into the spout and begin to drown immediately. When the waterspout fails, they fall up to 20 feet to the water’s surface. If you direct the waterspout to move across land, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 9+ each round to maintain it.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 124
Wringing free the tears of zeus;Re;Aq;"";"35";Touch;Conc;Group;"";"4";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Group, +3 size adjustment;This spell transfers the collected water in a cloud to a distant barrel, jar, or similar holding vessel. The stream of water can be controlled, so that several vessels can be filled. It takes approximately 5 minutes to empty a rain cloud of its watery contents. Because the rain drops are individual, the Target must be Group, increased 10,000 fold (3 magnitudes);Dies Irae, 96
Neptune’s wrath;Re;Aq;"";"40";Sight;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"";"";A gigantic wave is created in a very large body of water. The wave, which is only 20 feet high but up to a mile wide, is capable of capsizing ships at sea, smashing and drowning people near shore, and seriously damaging coastline communities. The tidal wave needs 5 miles of water surface to build itself up to proper proportions. The magus cannot control the wave without casting another spell.

The strengthening tide;Re;Aq;"";"40";Touch;Moon;Part;"";"4";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +1 Part, +3 Size) Source: Dies Irae, 4;This spell makes the movement of the tides more extreme throughout a port or natural bay, forcing them to rise higher and fall lower, and with greater speed. The effects are to impose a –1 penalty to all swimming and sea-faring rolls and totals along the affected coast.By observing the motion of the tides for a season or more in conjunction with the brightness of the moon, the magus gains insight into the effect that heavenly aether has upon the aether resident within the oceans. By replicating and strengthening that effect across the Moon Duration, the magus learns more about how aether behaves.;""
Tower of lava;Re;Aq;"";"50";Touch;Mom;Part;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +6 size, +3 elaborate design;"This spell sculpts a tower out of hot bubbling lava. The resulting tower is solid and rigid, but if its foundations remain in lava, then the tower will dissolve back into the bulk within a day. The Part target is required, because the spell does not use all the available lava.The tower is about the same size and dimensions as the one created by the spell Conjuring the Mystic Tower (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 153). A Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 15 is required to ensure that the tower is well made; failure means that the lava takes a solid but malformed shape.The Art of Auram";Hermetic Projects, 19
Air’s ghostly form;Cr;Au;"";"5";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"2";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +1 unnatural (the spell can be cast indoors);A thick fog forms around the magus, extending outwards for several paces.

Stench of the twenty corpses;Cr;Au;"";"10";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Diam;Makes the surrounding air stink horribly of rotting corpses.

Wreaths of foul smoke;Cr;Au;"";"10";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Diam;Thick, yellow, sulfurous smoke rises up from the spot you designate, spreading and thinning naturally, but thick enough to block sight in a radius of about five paces around the point of origin. For each round anyone breathes the smoke, a Stamina stress roll of 3+ must be made or a Fatigue level is lost. Once a character is Unconscious, further failed rolls result in the character taking a Light Wound each time. The area where the spell is cast will be damaged: small plants wilt and die, and tree growth is stunted. A faint stench of sulfur clings for days to anything exposed to the smoke.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 125

Broom of the winds;Cr;Au;"";"15";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 unnatural;Whips up violent, swirling winds around the target. The target must make a Size stress roll of 9+ to remain standing. If the target is braced or holding onto some support, he may also make a Strength stress roll of 9+. If both rolls fail, the target is knocked in a random direction. The target may be damaged, depending on whether he strikes anything.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 125
Charge of the angry winds;Cr;Au;"";"15";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 unnatural;A wall of wind roars away from you, starting up to 10 paces away and continuing until it dissipates naturally. The wind is confined by any existing barriers, but if unconfined it can be up to a hundred paces wide. All within the area must make a Dexterity + Size stress roll of 9+ or fall down and be blown along by the winds. The rolls must be made at the start of the gale and each subsequent round that the wind is maintained. You must concentrate on the gale. Missile fire into or out of the gale is futile, and marching against the gale requires a Strength + Size stress roll of 15+. Failure in this attempt mandates another Dexterity + Size stress roll of 12+ to keep from falling.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 125
Breeze from within;Cr;Au;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +4 magnitudes, wholly divorced from natural context;A very minor breeze is generated in the nose of the target, allowing him access to all of the air that he requires for breathing. While underwater, the target of this spell exhales a constant stream of bubbles that cannot be stopped by the target for more than a second by holding their mouth and nose closed. The breeze cannot be halted without the spell being dispelled or expiring. The breeze makes the manipulation of especially small and light objects by the target difficult.;Legends of Hermes, 106
Circling winds of protection;Cr;Au;Rego;"20";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 unnatural, +1 Rego effect;Surrounds you with winds that circle at great speed.

Clouds of rain and thunder;Cr;Au;"";"25";Sight;Conc;Group;"";"3";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;Creates a small but severe rainstorm, including lightning and winds. The storm gathers and breaks in a few seconds as the caster concentrates, and dissipates with similar speed when he stops doing so.Note that reducing the Range for this spell makes the storm increasingly unnatural, so versions of this spell with lower Range still have the same level.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
Clouds of summer snow;Cr;Au;"";"25";Sight;Conc;Group;"";"2";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +2 Group, +1 Size;Creates clouds that drop snow over an area about a mile across.

The spell does not affect temperature.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
Catapult of the mighty winds;Cr;Au;Rego;"30";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +2 unnatural, +1 Rego requisite;Terrifically strong winds sweep up an object (such as a barrel, a piece of furniture, or an unfortunate human being) and hurl it on a high, arched trajectory toward any point within range. If the projectile has Magic Resistance, this spell must penetrate in order to affect it. However, once the projectile is airborne, its motion isnatural and hence it bypasses the Magic Resistance of anything it hits.You must succeed at an aiming roll to hit the intended target. Because this spell gives the caster only indirect control of the projectile, the aiming roll suffers a –3 penalty and an extra botch die. The winds are strong enough to throw a grown man 20 feet into the air. Both the projectile and anything underneath it suffer damage when it crashes to earth: the damage is usually +10 but it could be less if the projectile is considerably lighter than an adult human.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 35
Clouds of obscuring sand;Cr;Au;"";"30";Sight;Sun;Group;"";"3";+3 Sight, +2 Sun +2 Group (for larger area);Alexander uses this spell to call up a small, but severe, sandstorm. This obscures the vision of everyone within an area 1000 paces across, and prevents travel by those unprepared for sandstorms. Alexander uses Movement Within the Sirocco to allow him to move freely through the storm, although navigation by sight remains difficult unless he takes bird form, using The Shadow on the Sand, to rise above the affected area.;Magi of Hermes, 12
Pull of the skybound winds;Cr;Au;"";"30";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 unnatural;Makes winds rise upward, pulling one object, creature, or person up to 50 feet into the sky before letting that target drop. Even a small building can be torn from its foundation, though such a building can be no larger than 20 feet to a side, and cannot be built out of a material heavier than stout wood. Uprooted objects fall randomly, unless you make a Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to choose where the objects will fall.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
Wings of the soaring wind;Cr;Au;Rego;"30";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 highly unnatural, +1 Rego requisite;Generates a massive gust of air around you that supports and pushes you along through the air at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. Hovering in place is difficult, and requires a Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 per round. It is dangerous for extended travel, because if you lose concentration, you are likely to sustain serious injuries (+15 damage, on average, although it may be more if the magus was very high up).;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
The incantation of lightning;Cr;Au;"";"35";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";A lightning bolt shoots forth from your outstretched hand in the direction you are pointing, doing +30 damage to a single target it hits. There must be nothing between you and the target. Those near the target must make Size stress rolls of 6+ to remain standing. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +4 unnatural);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
Breath of the open sky;Cr;Au;"";"40";Touch;Conc;Ind;Ritual;"5";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +4 size, +1 unnatural, ritual because of spectacular effect;You can call up a wind capable of devastating the countryside. You must stand under the open sky to cast this spell. While you cast the spell, a breeze picks up, blowing from you in the direction you are facing. When the ritual is completed, the wind strengthens to a gale roaring over the visible countryside and beyond, strong enough to topple wooden structures and knock down trees. The wind does not weaken while it is within your sight, but loses its force naturally where you cannot see it. If you turn away from your original facing for more than a few seconds, you have to make a Concentration roll of 12+ to maintain the spell. If you turn away for a minute or more, the spell ends. The air behind you is still.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
Wrath of whirling winds and water;Cr;Au;"";"65";Sight;Sun;Group;Ritual;"";"";This spell creates an immense storm, 40 or more miles wide, of hurricane intensity. The storm builds up while you cast the ritual, and dissipates in a few seconds when the spell’s duration ends. The gale-force winds and lashing waves cause immense damage along shorelines, and the winds, rain, and lightning cause extensive damage inland as well. Visibility is reduced to a few paces, missile fire is futile, and travel is nearly suicidal. Weak structures are blown over, and all but the most seaworthy ships are certain to flounder unless they can be beached before the storm reaches full intensity. The storm is not under the caster’s control, and moves normally. (Base 5, +3 Sight, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +5 size);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 126
Scent of ash;In;Au;"";"15";Per;Conc;Smell;"";"4";+1 Concentration, +2 Smell;The caster can smell and identify, on the breath of the air, the ash that has carried from volcanoes. This is enough information for the caster to determine the approximate direction and distance to each of the volcanoes he detects. A dormant volcano can be detected in this way from within one league (three miles), a volcano that has erupted within the last 100 years can be detected from within seven leagues (21 miles), and a volcano that has erupted in the last season can be detected from within 100 miles. Dormant volcanoes are detectable in this way because ash from their violent eruption is still present in the environment. The ash may have fallen to the ground, but some small (but detectable via Hermetic magic) fraction has been blown up into the air again.Of course, the huge plume of ash from a large on-going eruption can easily be identified without the aid of magic from many hundreds of miles away.;Hermetic Projects, 12

Whispering winds;In;Au;"";"15";Sight;Conc;Ind;"";"";"";The winds bear their tidings to your ears, allowing you to hear words spoken by any group of people within your line of sight, provided no solid barrier (including glass) intervenes. This spell is an adaptation of an effect known to Bjornaer the Founder, and fits poorly into the normal framework of Hermetic magic.(Unique spell);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 127
Sailor’s foretaste of the morrow;In;Au;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 size;You know precisely what tomorrow’s weather will be, and you gain a general impression about the weather for the week ahead. This intuition only applies to the place where you cast the spell, and is based on extrapolating current conditions, so it is occasionally wrong (precise, but inaccurate). Still, it would take something like an interfering magical being, or a volcanic eruption, to throw the prediction off.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 127
See the paths through the void;In;Au;"";"20";Per;Conc;Vision;"";"3";+1 Concentration, +4 Vision;This spell allows the caster to recognize the level of all boundaries or vestiges he can see that are associated with Auram, and to passthrough any of them into the Twilight Void if he should desire to do so.;Realms of Power – Magic, 27
Eyes of the bat;In;Au;"";"25";Per;Sun;Hearing;"";"4";+2 Sun, +3 Hearing;You can move about confidently in complete darkness by sensing air and its boundaries (for example, where solid objects are). You “hear” the boundaries of the air, so it does not permit fine discriminations. On the other hand, you can “hear” boundaries behind you.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 127
Sulfurous membrane;Mu;Au;Corpus;"10";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Sun , +1 Part, +1 Corpus requisite;This effect transforms the air entering the character’s lungs into a noxious sulfur vapor that causes +1 damage each round.;Hermetic Projects, 84
Rain of stones;Mu;Au;Terram;"20";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;Turns rain into stones as it falls, causing +0 damage every two rounds (they’re small stones), and maybe less if the rain is very light.

Talons of the winds;Mu;Au;Rego;"20";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 Rego requisite (additional effect: protect the caster);Transforms a wind into an abrasive medium that tears and claws at everything in its path. Soft materials like leaves and cloth are shredded, and people take +5 damage from innumerable bloody cuts and abrasions. This spell cannot be cast if there is not a breeze of some sort blowing, thus making it difficult to use effectively indoors. The caster is not affected by the spell, even if the wind is blowing directly at him.In Ossium of Bjornaer’s version of this spell a strange keening can be heard in the air as it cuts through targets. Ossium’s wizard’s sigil manifests by making many of his spells eerie or frightening.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 127
Curse of the evil humors;Mu;Au;"";"25";Voice;Diam;Part;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 Part;Converts clean air into foul humors that can cause disease. The humors form a cloud about 20 paces across and ten paces high. They are invisible but foul-smelling and noxious. Characters who breathe the befouled air must make Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6 or contract malaria (roll once, the first time a character is exposed). This disease, whose name is Italian for “bad air,” causes a Medium Wound. Once a character has contracted the disease, further exposure to this spell has no effect.The foul humors dissipate when the spell Duration expires. A brisk breeze can disperse the humors within two or three rounds, and strong winds make the spell unusable.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 36

Infernal smoke of death;Mu;Au;"";"40";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"25";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;Turns normal smoke from a fire into a thick, corrosive cloud. Anyone immersed in the cloud of smoke takes +25 corrosion damage (once only) against which armor provides only half its normal Protection value. Soft materials like cloth, fur, paper, and leather are charred and ruined by exposure to the noxious vapor. While you concentrate, any new smoke becomes corrosive, but even after you stop concentrating, the corrosive smoke remains deadly. It dissipates after several hours. The smoke is heavier than air, so rolls along the ground, pooling in low spots.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 127

Random screams, thumps, hisses, and other noises harass and confuse anyone within the fog, perhaps even leading them into danger. People have extreme difficulty navigating through the fog, especially through unknown territory. No more than seven people, who must be present at the ritual, can see normally through the fog. The fog does not dissipate until the spell expires.LEVEL 50 rAIn of oIl MuAu(Aq) 50 R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind, RitualReq: AquamTurns rain into droplets of oil. The rain of oil continues as long as the storm does, drenching the landscape with flammable liquid.The oil will evaporate at a natural rate after the rain ceases. A Creo Ignem spell can ignite the storm so that the oil burns as it falls, but this requires a Group target large enough to catch all the raindrops. Lighting the oil after it has landed is much easier.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 128
Room of stale air;Pe;Au;"";"15";Voice;Mom;Room;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Room;Makes the air in a room stuffy and uncomfortable. Any creatures that breathe air suffer a –3 penalty on all rolls involving physical exertion. In addition, for each round of exertion a character must make a simple Stamina roll of 6+ or lose a Fatigue level. This may cause panic in some creatures or people. The speed at which the air refreshes itself depends on how well ventilated the room is.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 128

This means that the weather may still be problematic out to sea, but at least the ships are able to safely leave the more treacherous inshore waters. The Sun duration allows multiple ships to sail under a single casting.The Art of Corpus;Hermetic Projects, 74

His version is specifically designed for his wife, such that she does not gain Warping from this spell (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 168). Frequent use of this spell often leads to an addiction, as the return of all the minor pains a human tends to ignore after the effect expires is overwhelming.

The player also removes up to 5 Aging Points currently allocated to the character’s characteristics.Assuming that the vis is available, and the caster is willing, the ritual may be cast multiple times in quick succession (to reduce a high Decrepitude Score to a much lower value). The ritual has no effect if the target character has a Decrepitude Score of 0. Note that the ritual does not reduce the actual age of the character, so it has no effect on the Aging Roll.Commentary included in the Lab Text suggests that the Mercurian priests used this ritual in a similar manner to the way Hermetic magi use the Longevity Ritual. The ritual is compatible with the Longevity Ritual.This ritual breaks the Hermetic Limit of Aging.;Mythic Locations, 97

Any previous time is ignored.This spell was invented by Aurulentus as a proof of concept. It is no longer used, as it is too expensive in terms of vis and causes Warping.

Conjure the walking dead;Cr;Co;Auram, Terram, Vim;"50";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"45";+1 Touch;This ritual creates a revenant — one of the magical walking dead. Different from an animated corpse, a revenant is a malefic creature with a Magic Might of 9. While it is lacking intelligence, a revenant possesses a violent personality and, if not immediately magically controlled, it attacks the nearest living creature. The Auram and Terram requisites are necessary for instilling the revenant’s magic powers.Base Level Interpretation: A level 10 Creo Animal spell creates the corpse of a mundane animal, while a base level 5 Creo Corpus spell creates a mundane human corpse. A level 50 Creo Animal spell will create a magical beast, meaning that a level 45 Creo Corpus spell will create a magical human.;Hermetic Projects, 117

The spell can only heal wounds, not such damage as missing limbs, or diseases and damage from poisons.This improved version of the Incantation of the Body Made Whole wascommissioned by a Tremere magus who wanted to save vis while healing a large group of wounded people. To use this during (or better, after) a battle, a tent may be used instead of a room. Using Target: Room rather than Group means that this spell can heal more wounded, if one can get all of them into a single room.;Magi of Hermes, 21

As with the spell Artemis’ Fertility, no other magus believes that this spell works as anything other than a giant waste of precious Creo and Corpus vis. Aurulentus points out that at his Covenant a higher than average rate of births is apparent, but most magi believe this to be merely a fluke. Other magi theorise that the mundanes are influenced by the fact that the magi have many children, and thus also act in a promiscuous way. So far, no-one has been able to replicate the spell, although Aurulentus gives copies of the Lab Texts of the spell freely to anyone asking for them.;Magi of Hermes, 21

At the completion of the Ritual, the figurine moves toward the person’s location at the rate of one inch per minute. When the figurine reaches the location, it spins rapidly. The target is located somewhere within the area covered by the spinning figurine. If the quarry’s location is not on the map used, the figurine does not move.Although only one map is required to cast the spell, multiple maps of various scales provide the best results. A character may draw a map for use in the spell with a successful Dexterity + Area Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If the roll is unsuccessful, the figurine does not move. The figurine is the focus of the spell and, as long as the magus maintains concentration, the figurine may be placed on any number of maps.A Dexterity + Craft roll of 9 is required to create the figurine depicting the quarry. The figurine created is approximately three inches tall. To determine the location of the target more precisely, the caster may create a smaller figurine. For each halving of the size of the figurine, increase the Ease Factor by 3.;""

The connection or member of the bloodline is treated as the root of the family tree and the caster gains knowledge of how strong that blood is within the veins of the target. This helps the caster to judge the validity of any claims to inheritance. What it can’t do is confirma target’s right to inherit, as this is dependent on other factors, not least the existence of other claimants and the inheritance laws in question.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 44

The skull becomes as pliable as clay for the duration of the spell. Once this spell is cast, a human skull can be pressed into a book-shaped wooden frame. When the spell ends, the skull reverts to its inelastic property, but retains its new shape. If later used in an enchanted item, the reshaped skull still gives the magus the same Shape & Material bonus (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 110).Base Level Interpretation: A base level 1 Muto Terram spell will change one property of dirt. The base level to create dirt is Creo Terram 1, and the base level to create stone is base level 3. A base level 3 Muto Terram would change one property of stone. Bone is harder than dirt but softer than stone, so a base level 1 would not be enough, but base level 3 would. Thus: Muto Corpus base level 3, change one property of bone.;Hermetic Projects, 103

This does not stop the character from also being a blood relative to his natural relations. Being a blood relative is worth a +1 Sympathetic Connection (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 84).This spell is possible because, although being a blood relative is a part of a character’s essential nature, Muto spells can violate a character’s essential nature (turn a man into a wolf, for example); the character’s true essential nature merely returns when the Muto spell ends.";Hermetic Projects, 91

Shape of the creeping ivy;Mu;Co;Herbam;"35";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";You turn yourself into an ivy plant about 12 feet long or high. You can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a plant. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While in ivy form, you do not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The ivy leaf you use to let yourself change back determines the kind of ivy the target becomes, and you cannot cast the spell without the leaf. (Base 25, +2 Sun);Legends of Hermes, 81
Stance of the patient tree;Mu;Co;Herbam;"35";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"25";+2 Sun;You turn yourself into a tree about 12 feet high, with a trunk about a foot thick. You can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a tree. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While intree form, you do not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The tree branch you use to let yourself change back determines the kind of tree the target becomes, and you cannot cast the spell without the branch.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 131

The spell does not damage either the child or the mother — although the mother may be seriously inconvenienced by a delayed late-term pregnancy — but both mother and child gain Warping Points due to being under the influence of a constant, high-power mystical effect (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 167).The spell can be cast at yearly intervals in order to delay a pregnancy for years, or even decades, and versions of this spell with other durations could be used to delay a birth until an astrologically favorable moment.;""
A punishment for brigands;Mu;Co;Animal;"40";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice +2 Sun, +2 Group;This spell transforms a human into a mouse. While in mouse form, the victim of this spell may be affected by Circle of Beast Warding, which prevents him or her from fleeing if cast swiftly enough. This allows the mouse to be gathered into a bag and transferred to a place of confinement, or casually destroyed.;Magi of Hermes, 13
Cloak of mist;Mu;Co;Auram;"40";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"30";+2 Sun;You turn yourself into a thick, cohesive mist of approximately human size. You can float through the air at walking speed and can see and hear what is going on around you. You can also seep through cracks, but cannot move through solid objects. You may return to human form at any time, but doing so ends the spell. As mist, you are subject to the forces of the wind. In order to cast this spell, you must inhale some mist, and you keep the mist in your “mouth” until you want to end the spell.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 131
Form of the zephyr;Mu;Co;Auram;"40";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"30";+2 Sun;"Transforms the caster into a strong gale wind. She flies at 50 miles an hour, but can increase this speed to that of a violent storm wind — 75 miles per hour — by expending a Long Term Fatigue level. She can travel at this increased speed for no more than an hour without expending another Fatigue level. This ability to gust is intrinsic to the type of wind into which the caster turns, muchas the Cloak of Mist (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 131) allows the caster to seep through cracks like natural mist. Note that because this spell turns the caster into a gale wind, she cannot travel any more slowly than 50 miles an hour. A different spell (of the same level) is needed to turn into a more gentle wind. The caster inhales a gust of wind to cast this spell, and can end the spell and transform back into human form by letting this captured wind free.While in the form of a wind, she can attempt to bowl over any object her size or smaller; this requires making roll of Strength + Concentration + stress die against the target’s Stamina + stress die. The defender may add Athletics to their roll if they are braced for the attack. If the caster’s roll exceeds her opponent’s, then the target is knocked off his feet and flung backwards one foot for every point of the difference. As a violent storm wind, the target is instead flung three feet per point of the difference. Falling damage (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 181) is inflicted on those knocked over; hitting an obstruction before the full distance flung back is reached counts as falling onto a hard surface (such as a wall) or a soft surface (such as a haystack). Knocking over inanimate objects has an Ease Factor of 9 + (3 x its Size).";Transforming Mythic Europe, 113
Shape of the ancient kite;Mu;Co;Animal;"40";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"20";"+1 Touch, +3 Moon; Harnessed, Tethered";You transform the target into a hawk, kite, or other small raptor, and any books carried by the target or clothing made of animal products that the target is wearing are also transformed. The spell is harnessed and tethered, so that the target has control of the spell and can end the effect at will, returning easily to human form when necessary.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 102

The caster also develops gills on his throat allowing him to breathe water but inhibiting his ability to speak, imposing a –3 modifier on all rolls to communicate verbally and a –5 to spell casting totals, as if the character were speaking quietly. While in this form, the caster can move at full speed underwater and does not suffer any penalties due to pressure.;Legends of Hermes, 105

Crocodiles are treated as fish when selecting a base level for this spell, +1 great Size change;This spell transforms Alexander, or someone he touches, into a crocodile. Crocodiles are fearsome foes in combat around water, and the stealth of the crocodile makes grogs that have experience with the form into useful amphibious or aquatic scouts. Alexander has a crocodile skin dagger scabbard, which he uses to cancel the spell at will.;Magi of Hermes, 13
Transform to water;Mu;Co;Aquam;"40";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"30";+2 Sun;You turn yourself into water, one pint for every pound of your weight. As water, you can hold yourself together unless someone makes an effort to separate part of you from the rest. You can roll slowly across the ground, but cannot move uphill. You can hear sounds, feel things that touch you, and can sense temperature. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. You cannot resume human form if a significant part of your body/ water is separated from the rest. You pour a small amount of water into your hands when you cast the spell.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 131

Medieval bestiaries recognize three varieties of lion. Male lions of the straight-maned type, which this spell produces, are lazier than female ones, and this has led to the formation of a small cadre of female warriors in the covenant, who are skilled in unarmed combat. A few carry bone weapons. Alexander sometimes uses a tail spur he carries in his trinket pouch as a physical prop to allow this spell to be canceled at will.;Magi of Hermes, 13
Curse of the werewolf;Mu;Co;Animal, Mentem;"45";Touch;Year;Ind;Ritual;"10";+1 Touch, +4 Year, +1 for Mentem requisite, +1 special effect;Over the course of a year, the target suffers from lycanthropy: the curse of the werewolf. With each full moon, the target transforms into the semblance of a wolf, losing both human body and mind to be replaced by lupine savagery. The effect goes beyond Hermetic understanding through the continued response to the moon without recourse to a device effect or linked trigger.This effect is inspired by observing the repeated transformations of a werewolf.;Dies Irae, 41
The silent vigil;Mu;Co;Terram;"45";Per;Moon;Ind;"";"25";+3 Moon, +1 for special effect;You can move into and become part of a rock formation that’s at least twice your size. While in the stone, you can hear what’s going on around you, but you can’t use other senses. The spell lasts until you come out, and you must come out where you went in. You have no need for food or drink, though you do age. Rolls to recover from Fatigue or wounds take twice as long to make while you are in the stone. Casting requisites are required for items you take with you into the stone.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 132

Alteration of the birth horoscope;Mu;Co;Vim;"55";Touch;Year;Ind;Ritual;"30";+1 Touch, +4 Year;Using insight from the observations of three-score horoscopes, this spell masks the essential birth horoscope for the given target, altering the effects of the heavens upon the target. Horoscopes created for this individual fail unless calculated using new birth information defined during the ritual, including the place, date, and time of birth, among other factors. Effects that derive a horoscope from a magical understanding of the target function as normal, but any information gained relates to the altered birth information. The original horoscope reasserts itself at the end of the spell’s duration. The effect is inspired by taking horoscopes for three- score individuals, each related to one or more of the others.;Dies Irae, 41

People transformed retain their human minds, but inherit all the passions and instincts of their new forms. The mist covers the target area, which must be in sight when you cast the spell. The mists affect the area until sunrise or sunset, and transform anyone who remains in the area during that time. For important characters, roll a simple die when the spell is cast and every half hour afterwards, and on a roll lower than the number of rolls made so far the mists envelope and transform them at some point in the next half hour.

This does no harm to the caster himself, and his super-heated blood means that he is immune to any heatbased damage that causes +15 or less damage (which includes lava).If the character is injured in melee combat, his opponent(s) must make Dexterity rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 to avoid being splattered by hot lava. Opponents who fail take +15 damage.

If the danger is something physical, such as a large rock falling on the magus, he reappears either beside or on top of the intervening material, never underneath or inside it.

Curse of the leprous flesh;Pe;Co;"";"25";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";This spell inflicts leprosy on the target, which causes a person’s flesh to rot off in a matter of weeks — a truly hideous sight. Much of the target’s flesh literally hangs from his or her frame, and there is a pungent rotting smell about him at all times. The target takes an Incapacitating Wound from the disease, and must roll as normal to recover. The target also loses a point of Stamina by the time the disease ends. If the victim somehow survives this curse, he is shunned by mundane communities.

The Quaesitor was able to determine that magic was involved, but had been unable to determine the caster.

If the initial point or endpoint of the leap is Warded, or if the caster’s magic is resisted, that resistance must be overcome much the same as when targeting a Warded area (see Aegis of the Hearth, Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 161). Tolides developed this spell to retreat into the shadow of a dark corner. If the endpoint of the transportation is exposed to unclouded daylight,Tolides must make a Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to gracefully reach his destination. A failure usually means that he tumbles and falls, is disorientated, or is enfeebled, whereas a botch calls for more-dramatic results to reflect his malediction. Note that this quirk is not a flaw of the spell, but an effect of Tolides’ Susceptibility to Sunlight.;Magi of Hermes, 131
Step sideways;Re;Co;"";"15";Per;Mom;Ind;"";"15)";"";The caster instantly moves to a location she can see within 50 paces. If a Dexterity + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 is failed, then something goes slightly awry: she might be facing the wrong way, or appears a foot or two above the ground.;Through the Aegis, 79
The promenade of caesar;Re;Co;"";"15";Touch;Mom;UnbornChild;"";"10";+1 Touch;Special: Requires Fertility Ritual Magic VirtueThis spell transports an unborn child instantly out of his mother’s womb, to a distance of up to five paces away. This is normally fatal for the child but does not harm the mother — the spell also removes the placenta. To determine whether the child survives, make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 3 + 3 for each month prior to natural birth. For example, if The Promenade of Caesar is cast on an eight-month-old fetus the Ease Factor is 6. An unborn child has a –4 penalty to his Stamina.;""
Trap of amber;Re;Co;"";"15";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter;The caster freezes the target in place for the duration of the spell.

Wizard’s leap;Re;Co;"";"15";Per;Mom;Ind;"";"15)";"";The caster instantly transports himself up to 50 paces in any direction, provided he can see his destination or has an Arcane Connection to it. His Talisman comes with him automatically but casting requisites are required to bring along any other clothing or equipment. This spell is very effective as a fast-cast defense to escape attacks or other mishaps, and can also be used for bypassing obstacles or launching surprise attacks.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 36
A bridge without wood;Re;Co;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch;Instantly transports the target to a point up to 50 paces away. The caster must be able to clearly see the destination. This effect can be used to cross rivers and even scale cliffs if a suitable arrival point can be seen.If enchanted into a device, this effect could be used in place of a bridge, and has the additional benefit that it can be easily removed to prevent enemies from using it.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 108
Arachne’s tuition;Re;Co;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+1 Eye, +2 Sun, +1 control over fine movements) Source: Magi of Hermes, 10Transcendence/Purity, +2 Sun;Cast by a master on his apprentice, this spell allows the master to control the apprentice’s movements for a day.The caster can suspend the spell, allowing the apprentice to continue with a task or exercise, and then resume control in order to help the apprentice through a particularly complex task or to correct his student and show how something should be done. The apprentice learns at a much deeper level by having his own actions controlled from within, rather than simply being guided from without.This spell is designed to assist with the training of physical skills, notably craft skills. Each season a master uses this spell to instruct an apprentice, he can add 1 to his Training Source Quality (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 164).This version was developed generations ago within Petallichus’ line of Verditius weavers, though others certainly exist elsewhere within House Verditius and perhaps also in other Houses.Two seasons of using this spell on an apprentice counts as one year of being under a constant magical effect as per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 168, and inflicts 1 Warping point in that year.It WIll be heAlth to your flesh, And strength to you bones ReCo 20R: Per, D: Sun, T: IndSpecial: Requires Holy MagicThe target’s body acts as if unwounded and unfatigued. Wound and fatigue penalties do not apply until the spell expires, and wounds may worsen but this will not be apparent until the spell ends, when accumulated Fatigue takes effect (and may leave the target unconscious). Consecutive castings delay the end of the spell, putting off the time until the accumulated wounds take effect — but the body can only take a number of consecutive castings equal to its Size + 2. Further castings have no effect.;The Contested Isle – The Hibernian Tribunal, 67
Jump of the lynx;Re;Co;"";"20";Per;Diam;Ind;"";"10";+1 Diameter, +1 for no falling damage;Like Gift of the Frog’s Legs, but with an additional magnitude to avoid the risk of falling.

Mercury’s winged sandals;Re;Co;"";"20";Per;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+1 Concentration;"The caster can fly. He must make an Intelligence + Finesse roll to change direction or speed; with an Ease Factor related to his current speed — Ease Factor 3 for walking pace, Ease Factor 9 at moderate speed, Ease Factor 12 at maximum speed.He can move at a maximum speed as fast as a running horse — about forty miles an hour — but this is reduced by one mile an hour for every point of Load he carries. He cannot physically carry a load which inflicts a Burden more than five points greater than his Strength (i.e. 15 points of Load for a character with Strength 0, 10 points of Load for a character with Strength –1, etc.). A second, unencumbered individual is a Load of 21 on average (see Grogs, Chapter 4).Concentration Duration is better than Sun Duration for this spell since in the former case the caster can end it at will, but the effect is often enchanted into an item that maintains concentration for the caster, for added safety.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 111
Remain within those walls;Re;Co;"";"20";Touch;Ring;ArcaneCircle;"";"15";+1 Arcane Circle;A variant on a warding theme, this spell cast with an Arcane Circle target both imprisons people within its bounds and prevents them from crossing into the Arcane Circle.The Arcane Circle target is usable by those who know the Hermetic Geometry Mystery, and allows the caster to draw a circle at his location while calculating and casting against a sympathetically identical circle in a remote location (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 95).Those with Resistance (through Parma or Might) are not confined or restricted unless this spell Penetrates that resistance. Arcane Connections to a named target may be used in order to increase the Penetration as normal, though the increased Penetration is only valid against that named target.As the base effect for warding spells is Touch, Ring, Circle, the Arcane Circle target raises the level of the spell by one magnitudeas it is more complex than its mundane equivalent, but no modifier is required for either Touch or Ring.;Magi of Hermes, 101

The gift of vigor;Re;Co;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch;Transfers bodily energy from you to any target who is at a lower Fatigue level than you. You are thus at the target’s current Fatigue level, and he or she assumes your previous level. If you lose a Fatigue level from casting this spell, the loss comes after the transfer. Magi have long looked for a way to restore their energy in order to cast more spells. This is the closest they’ve come.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 134
The protesting adversary held still;Re;Co;"";"20";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;The affected target is held fast and still for as long as the caster concentrates. Being held means that the target is unable to move his body, including his limbs, fingers, eyes, and lips. A magus who tries to cast spells while under the effect of this spell is likely to be subject to a penalty to his casting total, unless the intended magical effect does not require words and gestures (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 83).In Tolides’ version of this spell, small ripples of darkness quiver over the body of the target that seem to function as ropes, holding his victim in place.;Magi of Hermes, 132
The tireless flight;Re;Co;"";"20";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"10";"+1 Touch, +1 Concentration; Boosted, Harnessed, Tethered";Special: Requires Boosted, Harnessed, and Tethered Magic or Mutantum MagicThe target feels no fatigue for the duration of the spell, allowing her to endure a long journey without rest or sleep. She may also ignore hunger and thirst, and if she is injured she does not feel the pain. Practically speaking, she may ignore all Fatigue and wound penalties. However, this effect only masks the feeling, it doesn’t actually replenish her energy, so she still must actually eat and drink to avoid starving to death, and if she pushes herself too hard she may cause herself serious injury (Fatigue levels past Unconscious become Light wounds).The spell is tethered so that the target can control the effect, allowing her to stop concentrating when she has reached her destination and has time to recover. It is also boosted so that the duration may be extended to as much as a month if necessary, and harnessed so that the target can still cancel it at will.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 102

Division according to blood;Re;Co;Intellego;"25";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"10";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 requisite;To cast this spell, the caster holds a glass phial in each hand. One phial contains blood which may come from a mixture of sources. The other phial is empty. Upon casting the spell, all the blood from one individual only (in the first phial) is instantly transported into the second phial. By repeatedly casting this spell (and having a sufficient quantity of empty phials available), the caster may separate out the blood from a number of individuals. If the first phial contains only blood from one individual, then all of it will instantly transport into the second phial.The Intellego requisite is required to distinguish between the different sorts of blood in the phial. The target is Part because only a fraction of the blood (that belonging to one individual) is instantly transported into the second phial.;Hermetic Projects, 88
Sever the unwanted limb;Re;Co;"";"25";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"20";+1 Touch;"One of the target’s limbs is amputated cleanly and painlessly, without bleeding. The amputation requires an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 12; failure indicates that the target is left intact. If this roll succeeds, the target acquires the Lame or Missing Hand Flaw. If used instead of surgical intervention, the patient’s failed Recovery roll is treated as a stable result instead.";Art & Academe, 60

Hold chur;Re;Co;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 close eyes;Holds the target completely motionless for the duration of the spell. In addition, the spell closes the eyes of the target and keeps them firmly shut, so that he is unable to see for the duration of the spell.Chur is a troublesome grog of the covenant. A lesser version of this spell was used to stop him when he was doing mischief. Aurulentus soon realized that a more-powerful version would have many uses: as a combat spell, as a spell to act without witnesses, and as a spell to stop nosy mundanes. It was once used on a friendly grog who came under the influence of a mind control spell to stop him from attacking his group without harming him.;Magi of Hermes, 22

A botch means you appear in the wrong place, perhaps even in a wall.Praefactus of Bonisagus’s version of this spell always allows him to appear in a safe, unembarrassing place (assuming he doesn’t fail his Finesse roll).

Ward against the curious scullion;Re;Co;"";"30";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"15";[move “away”], +1 Touch, +2 Ring;This spell creates a circle that humans lacking Magic Resistance cannot cross. The spell gently pushes the target away from the ring. It is used to bar entry in many Hermetic sancta.This spell has an alternate name, Tytalus’s Prison, which comes from a story, possibly apocryphal, from the life of the Founder Tytalus. It suggests that in the early years of the Order, he cast down a wizard living as a feudal lord in the Rhineland, in part by trapping his mustered army inside a ring placed about the army camp. Members of House Tremere claim a similar feat for one of their early archimagi. Their story seems more likely because he was a vallationist, a builder of magical walls, which explains why the army was not able to deface the ring and escape. It is possible that this is a trick of Guorna the Fetid’s, which both magi knew. The second name also hints at an alternative use of the spell in a magus’s sanctum: to imprison an apprentice inside.;Covenants, 104

Seven league travel circle;Re;Co;"";"35";Touch;Mom;Circle;"";"30";+1 Touch;Everyone within the circle instantly moves to a location that the caster has an Arcane Connection to, within seven leagues (21 miles). This is sufficient to travel between Miletos and Didyma. If the caster fails an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9, then something goes slightly awry: the travelers might be facing the wrong way, or appear a few feet above the ground. Items worn or carried by the travelers (armor, weapons, bags, clothes, etc.) move too (which requires suitable casting requisites), but large items do not move. For example, a horse in the circle would not travel, nor would a tree, but a marble statuette carried by a traveler would travel (with a Terram requisite).The caster does not need to be within the circle. Note the spell is powerful enough to cause Warping on the travelers.;Through the Aegis, 79
Seven leagues travel;Re;Co;"";"35";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"30";+1 Touch;Transports the target to any place within seven leagues either that the caster can see or that the caster has an Arcane Connection to. If the caster fails an Intelligence + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the arrival goes slightly awry.This is an improved version of the Seven-League Stride, sometimes used by Aurulentus to travel with his wife. The spell is specifically designed for Semira, so as to not cause Warping if cast on her. After Aurulentus created Enchanted Items that allow for instant travel, this spell is only seldom used. It was once used to teleport a group into safety from a sinking ship.;Magi of Hermes, 22

Licking the blade;Re;Co;"";"40";Sight;Mom;Ind;"";"25";+3 Sight;When casting this spell, the caster holds a glass phial in one hand. When cast, the spell instantly transports a quantity of spilled blood that the caster can see and is within one league (3 miles) into the phial. The blood can be used as a +3 Arcane Connection to the character(s) from which it came. The Arcane Connection lasts for years (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 84).If the blood comes from a mixture of individuals, it must be sorted using a spell such as Division According to Blood before it can be used as an Arcane Connection. The exception is that the unsorted blood can be used as an Arcane Connection for effects that use a Group target to affect the entire group from which the blood came.This spell works because once the blood of a character has been spilled, it does not inherit the character’s Magic Resistance. Versions of this spell that instantly transport the blood a shorter (or longer) distance can obviously be invented. The blood might be spilled by a spell effect such as Crystal Rain, or it might be spilled via mundane means such as a sword blow or a punch in the face.The caster may require some sort of enhancement to his senses (such as Eyes of the Hawk) to target the spilled blood at the extremes of the range of this spell.;Hermetic Projects, 87

He remains there until the dream he is in ends, he leaves by the portal he entered through, or he finds some means to escape by using aspell.At the place in dream where he entered, a dream portal is created by the act of his entrance. The portal can only be affected by spells exceeding the level of the Morphean Gate ritual. (Paranoid magi have been known to devise more powerful versions of the spell to protect their exit portal.)Any physical traveler in this dream may leave through the portal, stepping out to emerge by the body of the dreamer. The portal remains as long as the dream persists. It is possible to encounter the portals of other travelers, and to leave through their portals. (Base 35, +1 Touch);The Mysteries, 109

Summoning the ancestor spirit;Re;Co;"";"45";Arc;Ring;Ind;Ritual;"";"";"One way of determining the rightful heir to an inheritance is to defer to someone or something that already knows the answer. The magic realm is replete with spirits representing every aspect of God’s creation including, conceivably, spirits of a given bloodline. Magical spirits of blood can be summoned through the form of Corpus using a base 15 effect as explained in The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 28. This is something that all magi can do and is not reliant on any Mystery initiations.The caster often prepares a warding circle and then summons the target spirit into that circle. The Arcane Connection used must intimately relate to the target bloodline; a crown for a royal line, a sword passed from father to son, earth from a family estate, and so on. Once summoned, the spirit can be questioned or commanded as normal and if it is powerful enough it should have knowledge of the true heir to the line.Should the magus wish it, he may also be able to command other information from the spirit concerning those who share its blood.

The impassable river;Re;Co;"";"60";Touch;Moon;Special;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +5 special based on Boundary;This ritual turns a river into a magical boundary that cannot be crossed by man, woman, or child. It cannot be crossed from either side and those who try may reach midway before they are turned back. Neither bridges nor fords offer any opportunity to cross. They are, however, left unharmed by the magic and they may be used once the spell ends. Variants can be created with the Until (condition) duration or Year, though both of these increase the level by one magnitude.Magi can create spells with nonstandard Targets quite freely, though they are generally not as optimized as if they had first researched the required Target parameter. In this case, a river is a special form of boundary and the target is particular to this spell so the parameter is treated as Boundary +1, as described in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 114.This ritual is designed to protect lands from invasion or to place a barrier in war’s path by disrupting the ability of one side or the other to travel. Magi working with nobles involved in the dispute may cast such things, even uninvited, to prevent the loss of life and to give parties the opportunity to talk.

The tessa and damen wards;Re;Co;Intellego;"60";Touch;Fire;Bound;Ritual;"";"";Cast into a flame, this ward prevents a person of a bloodline from crossing the boundary. This requires an Arcane Connection to the primogenitor of the bloodline, like the faerie Target bloodline does. The ward’s duration lasts until the flame is extinguished, or until the Arcane Connection expires. If a fixed Arcane Connection is used, and the flame is tended, this ward can last indefinitely. Despite its high level, the effect will likely have a high Penetration due to the caster being able to also use the Arcane Connection for Penetration. Casting with Wizard’s Vigil will also greatly improve the spell’s Penetration. The Intellego requisite is required to detect the bloodline (a specific fact about a person).

Clothe the naked form;Cr;He;"";"10";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";"Creates an individual garment made of linen or cotton, most commonly undergarments such as the chainse or braies (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert in Magi of Hermes). A Finesse roll determines the quality of the clothes; an Ease Factor of 6 results in a garment of standard quality. If an Ease Factor of 9 is achieved then the caster can specify the brightness of the dye and any regional variations in style.

Fill the capacious silo;Cr;He;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Group;Ritual;"1";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +2 Size;"Creates a silo of grain. A base Individual of Herbam is about twenty bushels of grain, so this spell creates about twenty thousand bushels, or 30 tons of grain (640 bushels to a ton). This would fill a cylindrical silo 8 paces in diameter and 20 paces high, or a barn 20 paces by 10 paces to a depth of 15 feet. This spell is underoptimized, in that it could create a hundred times more grain for the same spell level (since all Ritual spells have a minimum level of 20); however, that amount of grain would be virtually impossible to store. In a time of famine, that may not be a difficulty.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 120
Heal thy broken voice;Cr;He;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch;"This ritual spell mends a damaged wooden musical instrument. The instrument is returned to the peak of its former condition; that is, the height of its playing life after the instrument had matured and settled, and before decay or accident had affected it. The instrument is also cleaned of all dirt by this spell, as that helps bring it closer to its ideal.Instruments that have more than one part, such as a fiddle and its original bow, are treated as the same item and are both repaired so long as all parts are present at the ritual’s casting.A badly made instrument cannot be repaired beyond the height of its playing life, so it retains any flaws it had before it was damaged. An enchanted instrument can be made whole again, but any magical enchantments lost as a result of damage are not restored. This spell has a base level of 15 by analogy with the Creo Corpus guidelines, allowing the healing of “light” damage. Casting requisites are needed for instruments with any non-Herbam components (cat-gut, horse hair, metal pins, etc.).";Magi of Hermes, 139

Magi, even in inhospitableclimates, can usually find an alternative to galls that provides them with ink, but some covenants are so closed off from the mortal world, and have such an abundance of Herbam vis, that their magi find this spell convenient. There are variants of this spell that create far fewer oak galls, but its Ritual nature ensures that their level is no lower, and they cost the same amount of vis.;Covenants, 96

The canvas sides appear to grow out of surrounding vegetation, and erect and fasten themselves together.

Wall of thorns;Cr;He;"";"20";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"1";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 size;Within seconds, this spell creates a straight wall of woody, thorny bushes up to 20 paces long, 1 pace thick, and 4 paces high. The thorns, which are unnaturally resilient, have a +15 Soak, are cut by edged weapons only, and cutting through requires inflicting a Heavy Wound. Bodily forcing one’s way through the wall requires a Strength stress roll of 9+ and does +15 damage whether the attempt succeeds or fails. If the roll botches, an additional 5 points of damage are suffered. The wall grows out of existing bushes or fertile soil. An Athletics stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 allows a character to scale the wall, but the character takes +10 damage in the process.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 135
Weaver’s trap of threads;Cr;He;"";"20";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"2";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group;"A huge net of thick threads grows in the indicated area, filling a space 5 paces by 5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports the nets can hang vertically, forming a wall, otherwise they act just like a fishing net. Everyone caught in the area is captured within the nets. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9; or else someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Fire is exceptionally effective against the nets, but risks burning anyone caught within. The nets are not sticky, and cannot trap anyone who stumbles into them. This spell is a deliberate reference to the better-known spell Weaver’s Trap of Webs, but the thought of emulating a spider is abhorrent to the arachnophobic Julia. Consequently, her version of this spell is less potent, as linen threads are less strong than spider’s silk.";Magi of Hermes, 58

The bountiful feast;Cr;He;"";"35";Touch;Year;Special;Ritual;"";"";This ritual, which must be cast at noon on the day after the winter solstice, attempts to ensure that all crops that grow within its target will be healthy and fruitful. The spell protects against non-magical blight and other diseases. It can’t control the weather or prevent others from harming crops, but it does cause crops to be healthier, larger, and tastier than they otherwise would be. The target of this spell is the fields owned by those present at the ritual. The spell must be cast within the region affected by the spell, although that region need not be contiguous. Although food plants are affected most by this ritual, all plants are made healthier to some degree.

The tree springs from the ground in moments, towering to its full height of around eighty feet. The tree is still alive, but it has chambers within, complete with earthen floors and earthen hearths for fires. The magus decides the shape and design of the chambers when casting the spell. If the tree dies, the tower remains, now being a dead tree.;Magi of Hermes, 39

Conjuration of the seaworthy cog;Cr;He;Terram;"45";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +3 size, +2 for treated and processed Herbam, +3 intricacy, +1 Terram requisite;This ritual creates a fully-formed cog. The resulting ship is an exact copy of the cog used as a template during the design of this spell, even down to the knots in the hull and the adze marks on the keel. The only difference is that, assuming the magus makes the Intelligence + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the conjured ship is in perfect condition, as though each part of its construction has only just been finished. Any flaws in the original template are rectified where they would have made the conjured ship weaker or less seaworthy.A Terram requisite is required to create the bolts, nails, and other fixtures.Given the nature of the spell, a different ritual is required for each different type of ship that the shipwright wishes to conjure. To achieve this, the Hermetic shipwright must create a new ritual using the existing laboratory text as a guide and apply the principles to a new design.Unless cast on a waterway, the ritual should be cast within a boat shed prepared to receive the conjured vessel so that it does not topple and damage itself or its surroundings. Making the preparations forms a significant part of the ritual. Botches in casting are likely to conjure the ship in a position the magus did not expect, which could cause significant damage to his laboratory or bystanders.;Hermetic Projects, 65

The spell works on any vessel and returns it to the peak of its seaworthiness.Unless the ship is completely wrecked (having lost all of its damage levels), any Hermetic effects enchanted into the vessel are still retained. Enchantments are only lost where all damage levels have been lost.A Terram requisite is required to mend or replace bolts, nails, and other fixtures.;Hermetic Projects, 65

Shriek of the impending shafts;In;He;"";"15";Per;Sun;Hearing;"";"2";+2 Sun, +3 Hearing;Lets you know where anything wooden will be in the immediate future by a shriek that sounds in the air in advance of the wood’s coming. A piece of wood that is controlled may change course, so the spell is sometimes wrong.

The level of conversation depends on the type of plants; longer-lived and more noble plants have more to say. A single question and response takes ten to thirty minutes, with slower-growing plants speaking more slowly. Typically, plants can talk about the soil and about other plants around them, but have limited awareness of more momentary events, such as the passing of animals or people, unless that passing has a direct bearing on the plant (for example, a person cut its trunk). News can spread quickly through a forest when it has to, called from tree to tree on the wind. Bystanders cannot understand your conversation.";Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 136

Trees are reduced to bare trunks, while their leaves and all smaller plants turn to ash. You can walk for 7 miles with each casting of this spell. Use of this spell in faerie woods is not recommended. This spell was originally invented by a magus of House Flambeau, and he was awarded a prize for it by his primus.

As a free cosmetic effect the plants are consumed by a magical fire that races across the ground as the caster shifts his gaze. The fire is selective and leaves dead plants, wood, and all other things untouched.There can be little excuse for casting this spell and even less for enchanting it into a device and giving it to mundanes. However, the threat of it may be enough to keep covenant lands free from the interference of others.GENERAL;Transforming Mythic Europe, 45

It does not aid growth, or otherwise invigorate the crop. The selected base level of effect must be greater than the Might of the source of the magical plant disease, or of the disease itself if the disease has a Might score. In addition to the base effect level, the spell needs to penetrate the Magic Resistance of the magical plant disease, or more likely its source.;Dies Irae, 86
A useful inculcator of comments;Re;He;"";"4";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch;This spell allows librarians to add new descriptions to their catalogs, by sliding the letters on a page aside to create the space for the new entry. The spell was originally created by a magus-scribe to assist in glossing books, but is not effective for this purpose in newer works. That’s because the oak-gall “ink” in newer books is really a dye, and to move aside such characters, which are made of dyed parchment, would require an Animal requisite. This limitation can be ignored if magi use true inks, which are suspensions of colored material in fluid, to write their catalogs. This spell assumes an ink made of soot, gum, and vinegar, all of which lie within a single Form. A Dexterity + Finesse roll determines the quality of the text after the magus has relocated it. A result less than 6 indicates that the text has interpolated into and corrupted some other passage.;Covenants, 99
The clothier’s craft done in an instant;Re;He;"";"4";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch) Source: Magi of Hermes, 5;"Given an amount of linen or cotton cloth, the caster forms it into a garment according to her specifications. Typical garments made with this spell are the chainse or braies (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert in Magi of Hermes) which are traditionally made of linen. A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 9 for clothes of standard quality since it represents a day’s work done in an instant. If the Finesse roll fails the caster is left with a useless pile of scraps of cloth. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items).If starting with raw flax or cotton fibers, this spell would haveneeded to use the level 5 Rego Herbam guideline “treat and process items made of plant products” given in Covenants, page 51. Julia has no need for this version, since her Faerie Blood allows her to effect the transformation from fiber to cloth anyway.";""
Acorns for amusement;Re;He;"";"5";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice;This spell, taught to apprentices initially as an amusing game that allows them to vandalize their immediate environment with acorns, becomes a surprisingly effective spell in adult combat. It allows the magus to fling at a target any single piece of wood that is within Voice range and that is smaller than a pace long, wide, and deep. The damage a piece wood does when it strikes a target ranges from +1, for small, blunt piece, right up to +10 for logs a yard across. Severin usually carries a special hip quiver of sharpened, unfletched arrow shafts, although he has lost this in faerie. An individual shaft does +4 Damage.;Tales of Mythic Europe, 55

Rickety shack;Re;He;"";"5";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice;This is a very simple spell, designed to teach apprentices Finesse. It allows magi to toss about small pieces of wood, and when played as a game, the idea is to make the pieces land on their ends (to practice Finesse) or form rickety piles, with the loser being the apprentice whose added stick makes the pile collapse. After apprenticeship is over, magi can use it to move wooden objects up to a pace across, at walking speed.;Tales of Mythic Europe, 55

The piece of wood can be no larger than one cubic pace. This spell requires a Perception + Finesse roll. If this is botched the statue is ruined. If the roll exceeds the Ease Factor of 6, then the statue is serviceable, if not particularly pretty, and can be animated with the Carved Assassin spell. If the roll is not successful, then a statue is created, but it is too fragile or too blockish to use effectively with the Carved Assassin spell.;Tales of Mythic Europe, 55
Dance of the spidery ink;Re;He;Muto;"15";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"5";+1 Touch, +1 Part, free requisite;"This effect causes a small quantity of text (up to a page) to form into a spidery creature and walk from one piece of paper or vellum to another. The two pieces of paper or vellum are held in either hand of the caster. Casting the spell transfers the text to the second piece of paper or vellum.Note that this spell does not attempt to understand the moving text in any way. In order to preserve the sense of the text, the caster must make a Dex + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (if he understands the text) or 12 (if he does not understand the text). For this spell to work, the ink must be made of a plant product (which is common). A similar spell designed with an Animal, Corpus, or Terram Form will be needed if the ink is an animal, human, or mineral product.Similar spells with longer durations and a Group target could be invented to transfer the entire text from a large work. For a Lab Text, for every magnitude of effect (level divided by 5), it takes one hour to move the text. For a summa or tractatus, it takes one hour to move the text per point of Source Quality. Note that this only moves the text from one place to another; it does not create a copy of the text.The Muto requisite is required to make the ink stick to the newpiece of parchment.";Hermetic Projects, 93

If the victim ever botches, he cannot escape without outside help. If the length of wood has thorns, it does +6 damage when it hits, and again each time the target tries to break free, whether successful or not.

Work of a hundred querns;Re;He;"";"15";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Group;"This spell uses Rego craft magic to transform up to 10 bushels of grain into flour. The caster must make an Intelligence + Finesseroll against an Ease Factor of 6 to obtain usable flour, but this is of the poorest quality with pieces of husk still within the bran-heavy flour. An Ease Factor of 12 generates fine white flour instead. An advantage of this spell is that no grit from the millstones end up in the flour regardless of its quality. In Mythic Europe, the right to mill flour is usually protected by law (Lords of Men, page 77), and using this spell could get the magus into a lot of trouble; however, it will save them the cost of employing a miller.The guideline used was published in Covenants (page 51), and permits items made of plant products to be treated.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 120

The spell cannot repair splintered or broken wood, but it can reassemble or replace old parts if new materials are available. The spell cannot create any required materials that are not present.This spell uses the Rego Craft Magic rules from Covenants, page 49, and so the results of the spell depend on the magus’s Finesse as described in the table.Task Complexity Finesse Roll Clean instrument Trivial 3+ Re-tune crwth Simple 6+ Re-string a fiddle Easy 9+ Straighten a bow Average 12+ Re-glue a frame Hard 15+Casting requisites are required for non- Herbam components.

The elfin baker;Re;He;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Group;"This spell uses Rego craft magic to create a batch of 12 dozen loaves of bread in an instant from sufficient raw ingredients of flour, water, and yeast. The spell can even use raw grain rather than flour; if used at its maximum capacity it requires 10 bushels of either. Making basic bread is a Simple (Ease Factor 3) task for a baker, so the magus must make an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to succeed; otherwise the result is an inedible mess of spoiled dough. If this roll achieves an Ease Factor of 9 the bread is particularly good; an Ease Factor of 12 produces pandemayne, the finest white table bread.The guideline used was published in Covenants (page 51), and permits items made of plant products to be treated and processed.

Tomb of kaineus;Re;He;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Group;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Group, +1 size of group) Source: Tales of Mythic Europe, 5;This spell collects a tremendous weight of wood, grass, straw, and other plant material and dumps it on the target, burying that target completely. This spell needs to be aimed, but has a +12 bonus on the Aiming roll because of the sheer quantity of material involved, at slightly over one hundred cubic paces. It is designed to immobilize enemies who cannot be hurt directly because of their Magic Resistance. The name of the spell refers to the death of an ancient Greek hero with unbreakable skin. His enemies defeated him by piling tree trunks upon him until he could not move, andhe suffocated.;""
Carved assassin;Re;He;"";"25";Touch;Su;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;This highly useful spell animates a wooden object so that it follows simple commands, and solves simple problems, without the direct oversight of the magus.

Controlled growth;Re;He;"";"25";Touch;Year;Ind;Ritual;"4";+1 Touch, +4 Year;Using this spell, the magus can shape the growth of a plant over the course of the next year, as if he were properly pruning it, caring for it, and so on. The eventual shape of the plant is determined when the spell is cast and it can be as simple or as complex as the magus desires, although truly complicated designs, such as making a bush grow in the shape of someone’s face, may require a Finesse check. Once the plant reaches the shape and dimensions that the magus wishes, it stops growing until the spell ends or a new spell is cast upon it. Once the spell ends, the plant will then grow normally, but it still retains its magically ‘pruned’ shape, until it grows naturally out of it. Fast grow spells, or other methods used to accelerate the growth of plants, will still work, but until this spell ends the plant will not grow past the design limits originally set. This spell does not change the essential nature of the plant nor give it anything that an exceptionally good gardener couldn’t.;Magi of Hermes, 39

The mystical carpenter;Re;He;"";"25";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 flexibility;The magus selects a pile of wood, and the spell cuts, splits, carves, and joins the wood into the desired form. Any nails needed must be supplied, but wooden dowels can be formed from the supplied wood.The magus must make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the success of the process, substituting for a Craft: Carpenter roll, and if this fails, the results is just a mess of chopped-up wood. The Ease Factor is at least 3 higher than a carpenter’s Craft roll would require, so the simplest basic items have an Ease Factor of 6, increasing as the task gets harder.If the magus chooses inappropriate wood (such as green, unseasoned wood), the spell still acts — as if an unwilling carpenter worked against his better judgment — but the resulting goods will undoubtedly split and warp later. The magus’s choice of wood can be improved by The Carpenter’s Keen Eye, or the advice of a real carpenter.;Covenants, 51
The treacherous spear;Re;He;"";"25";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice, +1 Diam;This spell animates a wooden or woodenhafted melee weapon in someone else’s hand, and makes that weapon attack its holder until the wielder is dead or the weapon is destroyed. When the spell is cast, the weapon tries to break its wielder’s hold (Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 9+ to hang on). On subsequent rounds, the wielder hangs on by making Strength stress rolls of 6+, allowed once per round. If a roll to hold on ever botches, the wielder loses control of the weapon and is hit by it automatically (see below). While still in its wielder’s grip, the weapon does not strike him or her, but does not strike on the wielder’s behalf either. Once the weapon breaks free or is released, it attacks its wielder, using his Attack and Damage scores. The former wielder may fight the rebellious weapon. The weapon uses its defense rating as its Defense total. It has no Soak, and is “killed” after it takes a wound depending on its size. One-handed weapons must take a Medium Wound, while two-handed weapons must take a Heavy Wound. The damage of thrusting and missile weapons is halved when attacking the renegade weapon.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 139
Tree top walk;Re;He;"";"25";Voice;Conc;Group;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;This spell moves the branches of nearby trees so that the magus can literally walk from one tree to the next without ever touching the ground.

Of course, the trees’ branches still need to be strong enough to support the magus’ weight.;Magi of Hermes, 39

The unseen shipwright;Re;He;Terram;"30";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 size, +1 flexibility;The magus selects a pile of wood and formed iron fixtures, and the spell cuts, carves, and joins the wood into the hull of a target ship, repairing splits and holes under the magus’ direction. The worst damage is repaired first so that the vessel is always left seaworthy and the repairs are practically seamless.A Perception + Finesse roll is required against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide. The table on Covenants, page 49, is a useful guide, but a rule of thumb is that repairing a small leak or a splintered rudder is a task of average difficulty taking no more than a day for an Ease Factor of 12, while refloating a wrecked ship is almost impossible, with an Ease Factor of at least 27 (plus any modifiers that the storyguide imposes based on how long it might take a mundane shipwright to refloat the vessel).The magus must have appropriate materials to hand in order to make repairs.;Hermetic Projects, 64

The boat and all its contents are lifted into the air, and the caster may make Intelligence + Finesse rolls to change direction or speed. For typical Ease Factors, see The Woolen Steed of Araby, earlier. The maximum speed is forty miles an hour.The rigid nature of wood allows the boat to carry a substantial burden; in addition to being lifted itself, the boat can contain aLoad of 50. Note that an average person has a Load of 21, so the boat can carry perhaps two people and their equipment. Adding a Size modifier to this spell lifts a larger boat: each additional Size modifier multiplies the maximum additional Load by a factor of10.A boat made of metal (or other metal object) could be made to fly using the Rego Terram base guideline of 2, +2 to affect metal. Metal is even more rigid than wood, and can bear an extra 75 points of Load in addition to itself. As before, Size modifiers lift ten times as much metal and thus ten times as much Load.The extra magnitudes have been added to this spell by analogy with the Rego Corpus guidelines.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 112

Carnivorous house;Re;He;"";"40";Touch;Su;Str;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +3 Structure;This spell, designed to torment Severin’s beloved rival and then discovered to be effective in combat, allows him to animate wooden buildings. The building can accept simple commands, and follow them with some intelligence, without the oversight of the magus. Animate houses can appear to be haunted, because they creak and shift, while doors slam and furniture moves around of its own volition. In battle, a building moves at half the walking pace of a human, but can absorb a great deal of damage if constructed properly. Severin often prepares the house by packing it with statues, using the Rough-Hewn Servant spell, also given here.This spell also allows Severin to animate other large wooden objects, like carriages, huge statues, and ships.;Tales of Mythic Europe, 55

The free Terram requisite allows control and manipulation of the nails, bricks, and other mineral elements, but it cannot prepare them from raw materials; they must be in the required state.As with all craft magic, a Perception + Finesse roll is required and, given the difficulty of creating a full vessel in little more than an instant, the Ease Factor is relatively high. Small ships, up to size+5, can ordinarily be built in a single season, while larger ships take multiple seasons. The following table takes this into account and provides a guide to Craft Magic Ease Factors for creating vessels of different sizes:Ship Ease Factor River Barge 15 Coastal Buss 21 Large Cog 27 Grain Barge 30In the table earlier, building a river barge is a relatively easy task for a shipwright, which is a base Ease Factor of 9, but the construction is likely to take up to a season, which adds +6 to the Ease Factor for a total of 15. Building a Mediterranean grain barge is an impressive feat (Ease Factor 21) and would normally take a shipwright a year (+9), which means a magus faces an Ease Factor of 30 to create such a vessel with craft magic. Given the relatively high Ease Factors involved, this spell is most likely to be used in constructing small vessels very quickly as a means of income for the shipyard.The spell is named for Phereclus, a master shipbuilder of Greek antiquity.";Hermetic Projects, 63
The unexpected blossom;Re;He;"";"40";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +2 for size;This spell instantly brings a small orchard to blossom regardless of the season or the conditions. This does not bring the fruit, and a further spell of the same design parameters is needed for this. If that spell is not cast, the elements take their natural toll on the blossom, which may mean that the trees bear no fruit at all.Crops grown from seed, such as roots like turnips and radishes, leafy crops such as cabbage or lettuce, and grains like wheat and barley, do not blossom in the same way as trees. and thus variants of this spell are of limited value.Such spells are powerful and, unless they are designed with particular orchards or fields in mind, they give each plant within the target group one Warping Point with each casting.An alternative approach is to put a similar effect into an enchanted device that works on a single tree at a time but with multiple uses per day. This allows a mundane farmer to walk the orchard and bring trees to blossom as he passes. This is another example of how magic can flow down to those who work the land.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 41

The trees are compelled to come, and will likely be interested in whoever has called them. The attitude of the trees depends on the forest and the nature of the one who called. Once gathered, the trees hold meetings, summon ancient powers, and discuss the problems facing their kind. You may speak, and understand what the trees are discussing. The results of the conference may not be entirely in your favor. The trees remain animated for a month and may seek to return home before the end of that period.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 139

It is best used for field crops such as leeks or turnips since it transports the whole plant; if used to gather wheat, peas, or fruit, they must be processed further.

Snow immediately melts off of the target’s body, and moisture soon evaporates from both the target and his clothing. The target suffers no ill effects from normal extremes of cold weather. The spell also confers a +5 Soak bonus to resist damage caused by extreme cold, and a –5 Soak penalty to resist damage caused by extreme heat.

This flame doubles the weapon damage score for the blade (or adds +5, whichever isgreater), and can start fires as well. If the spell is cast repeatedly on the same blade, the blade gets hot enough to melt after half an hour, which ends the spell. Letting the blade cool for half an hour between castings avoids this.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 140

People between 10 and 50 paces from the caster suffer a –3 penalty to all attempts to target the caster. The light created by this spell illuminates a great area and, if conditions permit, could be seen from several miles away.

Test of the flames;Cr;Ig;"";"15";Touch;Ring;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;"Waist-high flames fill the target circle. Everything inside the circle takes +5 damage each round.This spell is of ancient origin and is thought to have originated as a ritual ordeal within the Cult of Mithras. It was once used by Flambeau magi as a test of endurance, a kind of alternative to certamen. The people being tested (including, usually, the caster) would stand inside the circle, without using their Parmae Magicae, trying to withstand the flames as long as possible. The last person to leave the circle was considered the winner. Etiquette suggested that if anyone were to fall helpless due to burn damage, someone would break the Ring and end the spell to rescue the unfortunate. This test is little used in 1220 because most Flambeau magi prefer standard certamen; also, some members of House Flambeau (such as the example character page 25 of Ars Magica Fifth Edition) possess a supernatural immunity to fire, giving them an unfair advantage in the test.";Houses of Hermes – Societates, 36

Fasting hearth;Cr;Ig;"";"20";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +3 Moon;This spell creates a fire, which is large enough to fill the hearth in a great hall, at the location touched by the caster. The created fire burns continuously for the duration of the spell with no need for fuel. This spell was created in the early days of the Order, and is common in covenants without a nearby source of firewood.

These walls can be created in any configuration desired by the caster, including configurations where the walls intersect one another. If a particularly precise placement of the walls is desired, the caster should make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine his success. Using Stockade of Infernos to directly attack a creature by placing a wall of fire across that creature’s location may be accomplished using the rules for aimed spells. Anyone passing through one of the walls takes +15 fire damage. Ranulf frequently places his walls as a set of two concentric triangles, or as a narrow path that leaves people trapped within them only a single direction to move.;""
Conflagrative servant;Cr;Ig;Rego;"45";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 size, +1 requisite, +1 complexity) Source: Magi of Hermes, 11;This spell creates a four-pace-tall manshaped mass of brightly burning flames. This mass of flames responds to the verbal commands of the caster. Commands have to be very simple, like “follow me” or “wrap yourself around that creature and hold on.” The conflagrative servant is made of fire hot enough to do +5 damage to things that the servant touches or that touch the servant. The conflagrative servant is insubstantial but cannot pass through solid objects. The insubstantial nature of the servant also normally prevents it from manipulating objects. When created, the conflagrative servant has a Size of +3, Strength and Stamina scores of +5 (although it has no substance to touch things), and Dexterity and Quickness scores of –2. The conflagrative servant has no Abilities. The conflagrative servant is subject to damage from Perdo Ignem spells and water. When the conflagrative servant is injured by these means, it shrinks in size. Every size category that the conflagrative servant shrinks, it loses 2 points from its Strength and Stamina scores and gains 1 point in its Dexterity and Quickness scores. The conflagrative servant is extinguished if it shrinks to smaller than a candle flame in size (Size –10).Ranulf frequently casts Flames of Stone upon his conflagrative servants in order to allow them to perform manual labor. This makes the conflagrative servant substantial and vulnerable to physical damage. Any damage done to the conflagrative servant causes it to shrink as detailed above. A Light Wound shrinks the servant one size level, a Medium Wound shrinks the servant two size levels, and so on. Ranulf also frequently uses multiple invocations of Discriminating Flames on the servants to enable them to use tools and enter structures without causing tremendous damage.;""

Everything between four and six paces takes +20 damage from the radiant heat, and everything between six and ten paces takes +5 heat damage. Within the four-pace radius the fire is hot enough to melt steel. This spell is sometimes actually used by magi who enjoy a Greater Immunity to fire.An early version of this spell was found in the lab notes of Flambeau himself.

Creatures apparently made of flame (creatures of another Form, illusions, or the effects of Hermetic Rego Ignem magic) who do not have an Ignem Form Might are also not detected by this effect.

A fire will still burn out if it runs out of fuel while under the effect of the spell, and a candle that is the target of this spell may still be extinguished by being pinched or snuffed out. This spell was originally designed to keep a candle burning on a windy and rainy night, but it can be used on fires that are much larger in size and can even be used to allow a burning torch to be brought underwater without being extinguished. The bubbles, smoke, and turbulence caused by submerging a fire that is under the effect of this spell prevent it from being a useful method of illuminating aquatic areas.;Magi of Hermes, 111

The colors of the target fire change from oranges and yellows to violets and blues. Any fire affected by this spell does cold damage rather than heat damage for the moment of the spell’s duration. Boreal Flames does not function on fires that are so hot that they do more than +15 damage. This spell was specifically designed to alter a casting of Pilum of Fire. Boreal Flames may be cast in conjunction with another spell; to do so the caster must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 15 (per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 82).

Let this fire sing you to sleep;Mu;Ig;Imaginem;"25";Voice;Sun;Part;"";"4";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 Part;"This spell affects a single fire, turning the very tips of the flames into pleasing music. The caster decides the kind of music he wishes to hear (a ballad, a whirly jig, etc.), and the spell accommodates. The music of the flames always incorporates a signature refrain, as though a sigil, with each casting. But the mood of that same refrain is adapted to the needs of the song.The flames play the same music all the while the fire burns, getting louder as the fire burns brighter, hotter, or larger, though the random nature of fire and differences in fuel mean that no two castings ever produce exactly the same performance.The spell ends when the flame is extinguished, its original source is fully destroyed or, for particularly long-burning fires, when the spell’s Sun Duration naturally expires. This spell cannot affect a fire that is already larger than a campfire or a fire in a hearth (essentially, any fire doing +5 damage), but a fire that grows larger than this retains the magic.Yestin originally designed this spell so that his fire, whether on the road or in his sanctum, could gently sing him to sleep. But the more he explored this new spell, the more he found new uses for it. It wasn’t just music that the flames could produce, but also speech (though limited in the range of words and voice to little more than those the caster imagines as he casts the spell) or other natural and unnatural sounds. These sounds always adopt the rhythm of the spell’s original melody, though. If left to sing (or talk) of its own volition, with no guidance from the caster, the fire sounds as though it is forming words, but this is an illusion; the sounds form true words by accident if at all.Yestin has used this spell in his sanctum to experiment with different harmonies, and has on occasion established choirs of candles each quietly singing a different refrain or a different note. The effect can be mesmerizing.A Finesse Stress roll (Mastery of the spell reduces this to a simple roll) determines how pleasant the sound is, but the size of the fire determines how loud it is.Size of Fire Equivalent SoundA candle flame A whisperA burning torch A conversationA campfire A song or heated discussionThis spell has the side effect of reducing the intensity of the target fire by 1 as flame is turned to sound.";Magi of Hermes, 139

When the spell’s duration expires, the campfire continues burning as a natural fire, if it has sufficient fuel and air. A person wearing the item suffers +5 Damage in the first round, and in each subsequent round provided the fire has sufficient fuel to continue burning.

Sublimation of flame;Mu;Ig;Auram;"30";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 size;This spell changes a fire elemental (or another creature made of fire) into air for a short period of time. This renders the fireelemental incapable of using many of its powers for the duration of the spell.If the target is in a well-ventilated area (such as outside), then the air that forms its body disperses. This inflicts an Incapacitating Wound on the fire elemental, and when its body returns to fire, numerous small fires erupt throughout the volume it has filled (about 50 paces across). These small fires cause +3 damage to anyone in the volume, and ignite flammable materials.If the target is in an enclosed area (such as inside a room), then the air is closely contained, and the creature suffers no damage. When the fire elemental’s body returns to flame anyone else remaining within the room immediately takes either +10 or +Might damage (whichever is greater) as the elemental’s incandescent body of flame coalesces.This spell must Penetrate the Magic Resistance of the fire elemental. This spell is able to affect creatures of up to Size +6 (this includes fire elementals of up to Might 25);Hermetic Projects, 26
Summer’s blessing;Mu;Ig;Terram;"30";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, requisite is free, +1 constantly releasing heat;"This spell turns the heat and flames of a large campfire into a small, very hard object, such as a gem or a piece of metal. If the object is broken the flame returns, but it dies if there is nothing to burn. While the spell lasts, the object is constantly emitting heat equal to a warm summer’s day; this heat warms everything within a few paces.";Magi of Hermes, 124
Flames of sculpted ice;Mu;Ig;Aquam;"35";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 size;Turns a fire up to the size of a small house into ice. The ice forms beautiful sculptures of leaping flame, until it begins to melt. When the ice has melted halfway, the flames start again, but probably won’t spread, because of wet surroundings.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
A time for slumber;Pe;Ig;"";"5";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;When this spell is cast around a camp, it dims the blinding light of the desert sun.

Chill touch of exposure;Pe;Ig;"";"5";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch;"The target shivers like an unwanted baby left alone in a cold and frosty dell, losing a Fatigue level. Repeated casting of this spell can cause the character to eventually become unconscious; this usually takes 5 castings. Mastering this spell with the Multiple Casting mastery can reduce the time that this takes. Once the target is unconscious, additional castings of the spell increase the length of time that the target naturally remains unconscious (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 179)If the target is unconscious at either sunrise or sunset, then his Parma Magica will go down.";Hermetic Projects, 84

Let the sun not bother me this day;Pe;Ig;"";"10";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 Sun;"This spell cools the caster to a comfortable level, no matter how hot the sun is or how long he stays out in it. As Yestin puts it, “the day becomes as pleasant as a spring afternoon, and loses the wrathof summer’s heat”. The target is still affected by the light of the sun, but its warmth is regulated. All other sources of heat affect the caster naturally.This spell ends either when it reaches its natural duration, when the caster moves into a fully enclosed room (or cavern system or basement), or in the event of an eclipse; it ends when he goes anywhere that sunlight cannot reach him.Petalichus the Weaver of Verditius bought a copy of this spell from Yestin when the bard travelled to the Tribunal of Thebes one year. The Verditius claimed to be interested “from a research point of view.” Unknown to Yestin, Petalichus ultimately used the spell in a long-running feud with Solar Magnus of Tytalus, a feud that ended in Stonehenge with the death of Solar Magnus.";Magi of Hermes, 140

Banishment of warmth;Pe;Ig;"";"15";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"";"";"This practical spell expels the warmth from all items that have been set up inside the affected Circle. Lowering the temperature of the Circle to slightly above freezing, Banishment of Warmth can be used to prevent goods related to Animal, Herbam, or Corpus from decaying naturally for a couple of days. The spell is not designed as an offensive weapon, but living creatures that remain in the Circle for an extended period of time do start losing Fatigue due to the cold. Note that the spell must be cast after the targets have been set up inside the Circle; it does not affect items that are placed into the Circle once the spell has been cast. A closer look at the enchanted Circle reveals a translucent waft of vapor over the affected area. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Ring, free cosmetic effect)";Magi of Hermes, 132
Extinguish the abhorrent flame;Pe;Ig;"";"15";Sight;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";This spell instantly extinguishes any individual fire up to the size of a campfire. The extinguished fire can be relit by mundane or magical means, but does not relight by itself.To feel comfortable, Tolides shuns the heat and light of fires almost as much as he avoids sunlight, and he uses this spell to extinguish flames even from afar. It also comes in handy for affecting the sources of light of those who depend on flames to see in the dark. (Base 4, +3 Sight);Magi of Hermes, 132
Cloak of darkness;Pe;Ig;"";"20";Sight;Diam;Part;"";"3";+3 Sight, +1 Diameter, +1 Part, free cosmetic effect) Source: Magi of Hermes, 13;All light around the head of the target is completely extinguished, leaving the victim mobile and unhampered, but engulfed in a tight- fitting cloak of darkness — an aurora of opaque, black flame that moves with the target for the duration of the spell. The target is blind, unless affected by a spell that permits the caster to see in complete darkness, such as Eyes of the Bat.;""
Frosted timber;Pe;Ig;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part;This spell cools the bark of a tree, the wood of a cart, or even the planks of a house so that it is cool to the touch. This a good effect to help dispel the heat of the night and keep the magus cool during the hotter seasons.;Magi of Hermes, 40
Orb of darkness;Pe;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Diam;Part;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 Part, +1 Size;This spell represents a larger variant of the Cloak of Darkness, and removes all light from the designated target area. The effect manifests in the form of a irregular sphere of writhing darkness that contains everything within three paces of the affected target. Anyone inside the affected space is effectively blind. To see through the area from either side, a spell that permits the target to see in complete darkness, like Eyes of the Bat, is required.The spell must be targeted at an object, individual, or other specific point in space. This location functions as a focus for the effect only, as the spell targets the light within the Part of space surrounding the focus, rather than the focus itself. Thus, the spell does not have to penetrate the Magic Resistance of anyone inside the target area, but only the resistance of the focus. If it fails to penetrate, the spell fails. If the focus is an individual or object that moves, the created darkness moves along with it. For example, if the spell is cast on a pebble, and that pebble is thrown into a lake, the blob of darkness will sink to the bottom.;Magi of Hermes, 133
Quench the raging conflagration;Pe;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";Extinguish any fire up to the size of a house fire. Many Flambeau magi learn this spell, or carry items enchanted with a similar effect, to control any incidental fires caused by errant Creo Ignem magic. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 size);Houses of Hermes – Societates, 37
Soothe the raging flames;Pe;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice;Eradicates the heat of a bonfire, which, however, continues to burn until the fuel already covered in flame is consumed. The flames do not spread, or harm anything beyond what they were already burning. If the fire is extinguished and relit, it will burn hot again, as it is now a different fire.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
Abyssal touch;Pe;Ig;"";"25";Voice;Diam;Group;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 Group;For two minutes, all members of the affected Group are thoroughly chilled. Living targets lose one Fatigue level per round until they fall unconscious, while objects are considered frozen. The chill does not persist long enough to actually damage living targets.In Tolides’ version of this spell, dark vapor emerges from the ground near the designated Group and engulfs the affected targets. The apparition does not physically constrict the victims, and does not block their senses, but keeps chilling them for the duration of the spell.;Magi of Hermes, 133
Conjuration of the indubitable cold;Pe;Ig;"";"25";Voice;Mom;Part;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Part, +2 size;Cools the air within ten paces of the target, leaving it slightly below freezing. All nonliving things are chilled thoroughly, not just on the surface. All living things (except you, if you cast with a Rego requisite) lose one Fatigue level. House fires become as small as campfires, bonfires become as small as torch fires, and campfires and smaller fires go out.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
Well without light;Pe;Ig;"";"25";Touch;Sun;Str;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +3 Str;Removes light from the target structure. Only spells greater than level 25 can create light within this area. When casting this spell, magi typically clench a hand into a fist, and the light flows into the fist like a living entity, until the entire area is dark.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
Wizard’s icy grip;Pe;Ig;"";"30";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"20";+2 Voice;Chills a single target so that it takes +20 damage. If this is enough to kill, the target is frozen solid. Armor does not add to Soak against this spell.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
Wizard’s eclipse;Pe;Ig;"";"35";Touch;Diam;Bound;Ritual;"2";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +4 Bound, +3 size;The sun is eclipsed within the target area, making it as dark as night. The darkness begins very suddenly — the superstitious are likely to panic, especially if they see that there is normal daylight just beyond the boundary of the spell.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
Domain of darkness;Pe;Ig;"";"45";Touch;Year;Bound;Ritual;"2";+1 Touch, +4 Year, +4 Boundary, +2 Size;This ritual creates a domain of darkness in the designated Boundary, which can cover an area with a diameter of nearly 1000 paces. No natural light that is brighter than a soft evening glow is ever shed within its Boundary, regardless of the season or time of day. Due to the continuous lack of sun, the whole area becomes cold and uncomfortable for living beings. Warm air from outside is not actively resisted, but almost never reaches the center of the domain. Even fires created by mundane or magical means appear weak, and only dimly lit. Plants within the Boundary turn to leafless caricatures of life sooner or later. Note that a Boundary requires a well-defined border, such as the tree line of a grove, the cliffs of a steep valley, or the shore of an island.A brief note on the specific use of this spell that should not to be mistaken for traits or side-effects of the spell itself: The area affected by Domain of Darkness provides a haven for all creatures that shun the light. It represents Tolides’ latest attempt to establish some sort of abode in a domain of his own. Because the affected Boundary is inhabited by a practicing diabolist, and the ritual needed to cast the spell is often powered by Infernal vis, the aura of the Boundary slowly but steadily accumulates more and more traits of Infernal Warping. For example, animals that stay inside the domain for an extended period of time are likely to turn into Corrupted Beasts — repellent aberrations of nature (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 77). One day, the affected Boundary might even become a regio of its own, which is exactly what Tolides has planned.;Magi of Hermes, 133
Tremulous vault of the torch’s flame;Re;Ig;"";"5";Voice;Mo;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice;Causes a fire to quiver a few seconds and then make a leap of up to 10 feet in any direction. A Targeting roll is required to hit a specific target. The flame stays at the spot it hits if it can burn there (see rules for fire damage on page 181). Otherwise, it simply scorches the spot and goes out (doing +5 damage).;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 142
Discourse of glowing tongues;Re;Ig;"";"10";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration;"This spell controls the sounds created by a fire to make them form words. The alteration is subtle; words are formed of the natural roar, crackles, and hisses of the fire — not with any additional sound. Someone listening at the fire who knows to expect the words can make them out with a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 3. A character who is not aware that the fire is speaking needs to roll against an Ease Factor of 9 on a Perception + Awareness test to realize that the fire is making words at all.Ranulf and his apprentice (who is also quite talented with the Art of Ignem) use this spell to target fires that are subject to the Unified Flame spell. Because the Unified Flame is cast by Ranulf within his covenant, the communication is not impeded by his covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth. Neither Ranulf nor his apprentice knows Discourse of Glowing Tongues as a formulaic spell; instead, they cast it spontaneously when needed. Note that this spell has a Range of Touch and may be difficult or even damaging to cast on a particularly hot fire.";Magi of Hermes, 111
Leap of the fire;Re;Ig;"";"10";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 size;"Causes a bonfire to leap of up to 10 paces in any direction, where it catches if there is fuel, or burns out if there is none. Make a Targeting roll to hit a target; the flames do +10 damage.";Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 143
Ward against flame;Re;Ig;"";"15";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Ring) Source: Covenants, 10;This spell creates a circle that mundane fires cannot cross. It is used, in many laboratories, around heat sources that could tip or spill. It is also popular around grain stores. The fine dust that is found wherever people store flour is highly flammable, and many magi use this spell to quarantine areas in mills and granaries from the fires that are used in other parts of the buildings. Hermetic librarians use this spell far more than is necessary: in one covenant, for example, the drip catcher on every candleholder has a circle for this spell etched into its surface.This spell sometimes encloses an entire laboratory, but is of limitedusefulness in that application. The fires caused by laboratory accidents are often magically powerful enough to overcome this ward, or hot enough to burn through the wooden boards used as floors and ceilings in many covenants. The spell does keep fires bottled, but this makes them more intense, until they burn through their supply of fuel and air.;""
Coerce the spirit of fire;Re;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;Makes a fiery spirit obey the caster as long as she can coerce it with threats. The more lurid and dramatic her threats, the more cooperative the spirit is. If the spell penetrates the spirit’s Magic Resistance, make a stress roll of Com + Leadership to see how effective the maga’s threats are. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty depending on the potency of the threats, but note that any roll other than a botch compels at least minimal obedience, while increasing rolls indicate a more cooperative spirit.;The Mysteries, 28

Command the living fire;Re;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;This spell allows the caster to control the actions of a fire elemental up to Size 0, if the Penetration Total exceeds the elemental’s Magic Might. For larger elementals, versions of the spell with a Size modifier to the Target are required. If an elemental is already under supernatural control, the most recent spell or power used is the one that commands it.;Realms of Power – Magic, 133
Light shaft of the night;Re;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Conc;Group;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;Collects moonbeams and starlight into a single vertical shaft of soft, silvery light that moves under your control. It illuminates an area 15 paces across with light nearly equal to sunlight (if the moon is out) or moonlight (if the moon is not out). If the sky is overcast, the spell does not work. Can only be cast under the night sky.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 143
The obedient fire;Re;Ig;"";"20";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 Size) Source: Houses of Hermes – Societates, 3;Control the rate and direction in which a fire spreads. The caster may make the fire spread across combustible surfaces as fast as a man walks. It can leap most gaps as much as one pace across but cannot cross even the tiniest trickle of water. The caster can prevent the fire from spreading in certain directions but cannot actually keep it from burning things it touches. He could, for instance, make a fire spread into the shape of a circle and then expand outward, or keepthe fire away from himself while it follows his enemies around the room. If the fire surrounds a person, its heat is non-magical and so bypasses Magic Resistance. An aiming roll is required to get the fire close enough to do damage. If the fire grows larger than a basic Room Target, the caster loses control of it entirely.;""
Burst of the sweeping flames;Re;Ig;"";"25";Sight;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";This spell causes a fire to explode outwards from its source along the ground, as if a giant wind were blowing on it from above. The fire travels for no more than 10 paces, but it ferociously ignites anything in its path. The original fire is left dead, but in all probability a number of new fires will be started. The flames cause +5 to +15 damage, depending on the intensity of the original fire. (Base 10 (4 + 2 magnitudes for the intensity of the fire), +3 Sight) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 143;""
Discriminating flames;Re;Ig;"";"25";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 size;This spell controls a fire, preventing it from directly heating or burning a particular substance (such as human flesh or the wood of the elm tree) chosen by the caster at the time of casting. The caster must either have a sample of the material to be protected, or must cast the spell with an appropriate casting requisite. Ranulf frequently casts this spell several times upon the same fire in order to make the fire safe for specific environments. The spell only affects the fire that it is cast upon. Other fires, including fires that have been lit from the subject of this spell, are not affected. Fires up to ten times the size of a hearth fire can be targeted with this spell.;Magi of Hermes, 112
Ward against heat and flames;Re;Ig;"";"25";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 for up to +15 damage, +1 Touch, +2 Sun;Keeps heat and fire at bay, unable to approach within 1 pace of the target. This renders the target immune to damage from flames or heat of intensity less than that of molten iron. The target gets a +15 Soak against all fire-related damage. Any fire doing less than +15 damage per round doesn’t penetrate the ward. Such fires simply dim at the protected person’s passing and flare back up after he or she is gone.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 143

A fire serves as an Arcane Connection to any elemental fire spirit that resides in the area.";The Mysteries, 293
Master the airy spirit of fire;Re;Ig;"";"30";Voice;Moon;Ind;"";"";"";Commands an airy spirit associated with the elemental form of Ignem to serve the magus for Moon duration.

Petite phoenix;Re;Ig;"";"30";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"10";+ 2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 size;This transmutes a fire into the shape of a small bird. The reshaped fire moves as the will of the caster directs. The fire has a Size of –6, a Dexterity of +3, and a Quickness of +7. The heat of the original blaze is unchanged by this spell. The bird has no more substance than the original fire did and is not subject to most types of attacks, but still may be extinguished with water, Perdo Ignem magics, and similar methods. Being made entirely of flame, the petite phoenix can not pass through solid objects, but objects that are smaller than the bird may pass through it. Ranulf often uses Petite Phoenix in conjunction with Transmutation of Fire to move objects such as doors and inconvenient sections of walls. Fires targeted by this spell can be up to ten times the size of a hearth fire.;Magi of Hermes, 112
Summon the airy spirit of fire;Re;Ig;"";"35";Arc;Mom;Ind;"";"";"";Summons the target airy spirit associated with Ignem into the caster’s presence. There is nothing to compel the spirit to stay once summoned.(Base: 15, +4 Arcane Connection);Through the Aegis, 105
Unified flame;Re;Ig;"";"35";Arc;Sun;Group;"";"3";+4 Arcane Connection, +2 Sun, +2 Group;This spell alters the target fires to resemble one another in all ways. The fires to be targeted by this spell must all be Arcane Connections to one another. The targeted fires change over the course of a few minutes to mirror one another completely in the shape of their flames, the sound of their roar and crackling, and the smoke that they produce. Any changes in one fire will be reflected in the others. The affected fires all take on a slightly unnatural appearance as their flames move into a configuration that does not completely match the logs that they are burning, and they are altered by the sigil of the casting wizard.When Ranulf’s apprentice is away from him, the apprentice is instructed to kindle a fire using a coal stored in the Chest of the Ember Seed just after sunset every evening. While this spell is normally intended to unite two fires, the spell was designed with a Target of Group. Ranulf believed that the effort required to create a spell that affected just two fires would be as great as or greater than the work needed to develop a spell that targeted a group, because of the difficulty of using non-standard Targets. As a result, more than two fires can be affected by this spell, and the caster could be completely unaware of the additional fires (possibly allowing a communication to be intercepted, see Discourse of GlowingTongues above).This spell is an example of magic created to match the needs of the magus. For most magi, any number of Intellego spells would provide a significantly easier method of communication. Yet for Ranulf, who has a Magical Focus in unnatural fires and the Deficient Technique Flaw with Intellego, the season that he invested to invent this spell was a wiser choice than trying to learn magics not suited to his talents.;Magi of Hermes, 112
Ward against immolation;Re;Ig;"";"35";Per;Diam;Ind;"";"4";+1 Diameter, +6 intensity of heat;"The caster is rendered immune to heat and fire less than that of the most powerful of Ignem magics. The caster and his possessions receive a +35 bonus to Soak against damage from heat. While this spell is active, Ranulf can (due to the resistance to heat provided by his Ignem Form resistance bonus) tolerate, barely, the heat generated by his Self Immolation spell. However, Ward Against Immolation, like Self Immolation, is a spell of Duration Diameter. As a result, Ranulf must cast this protective spell prior to casting Self Immolation; if Ranulf fails to cast Ward Against Immolation again before the original casting expires, the Self Immolation spell would cause him severe harm (as a Personal Range spell, it does not need to penetrate his Magic Resistance).";Magi of Hermes, 112

False window;Cr;Im;"";"5";Touch;Sun(someversionsuseRing);Ind;"";"2";+2 Sun or Ring, +1 Individual;This spell allows the magus to trace the frame of a door or window and create a miniature that seems to show something that lies beyond the frame. A Perception + Finesse roll is required to craft a convincing illusion. The Ease Factor is 9 if the image seems to show a room, 12 if it seems to show a structure, or 15 if it seems to run to the horizon. These numbers already include the reduction for limiting the viewer’s line of sight, but could be reduced or increased by familiarity with the depicted scene.Many casters of False Window add an additional magnitude, so that figures within the image appear to move, and the pattern of light changes to suit the time of day, but this simpler version creates only a static image. This spell also models similar spells for the other senses: a mirror that plays a tune, provided its face is not turned toward a wall, is an example. Directly created species like these are resisted by the Parma Magica.;""

The soldier responds to the mental direction of the caster, who must maintain concentration as the soldier moves. The image contains only visual elements. This spell is used by Hermetic apprentices to play Bellum. Note that other spells can be designed that make different illusionary images. A Roman soldier is a standard image, but any Size 0 figure is allowed, including knights, club-wielding barbarians, and supernatural creatures like fauns and satyrs.;Apprentices, 58
Fooling the eye;Cr;Im;"";"10";Sight;Mom;Part;"";"2";+3 Sight, +1 Part;A magus using this spell creates the correct species for the swift movement of a small bright object, and casts them at the head of the target. Virtually all humans have in involuntary reflex that makes their eyes track the paths of moving objects, particularly those that might strike them. The magus uses this reflex against the victim, because when she looks where the object should be, she makes eye contact with the magus. This allows the magus to cast spells with Eye Range on the victim.This spell does not require a Finesse roll, because it does not simulate a particular object.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 68
Phantasm of the talking head;Cr;Im;"";"10";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"2";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 intelligible speech;Creates an illusory face on a wall or other flat object.

Silent shout;Cr;Im;"";"10";Sight;Mom;Part;"";"2";+3 Sight, +1 Part;This spell creates a burst of species, matching the caster’s voice, which strike the target in the head. This spell requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to make the voice sound convincingly like that of the magus (the base Ease Factor is 9, with a –3 modifier for deep familiarity), but even if the roll fails, the target still hears the message. This spell is used on battlefields, or to instruct apprentices in the Tribunal chamber. It takes advantage of the directional nature of miniatures to prevent others from overhearing its contents.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 68
An enemy awash in the pure sigil of the magus;Cr;Im;"";"15";Sight;Conc;Part;"";"2";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +1 Part;This spell washes the target with concentrated visible species,overloading the eyes. It requires no Finesse roll, because the species do not construct an image. In this case, the sheer number of species is being used to overload the capacity of the eye, so that the target is unable to see anything else. The spell’s name comes from its appearance, which is always based strongly on the sigil of the caster. The victim’s eyes recover two minutes after the spell is complete, or in only a round if the victim thinks to close his overburdened eyes when first struck by the spell.Spells similar to this one can create detailed images, but that requires Finesse rolls.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 68
Book of images;Cr;Im;"";"15";Touch;Ring;Ind;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Ring, +1 moving images, +1 intricacy) Source: Magi of Hermes, 12;This spell creates moving sounds and images that are stored in a circle (such as a drawn circle on paper) as long as it is intact. With this spell it is possible to create a whole book or gallery of fantastic images and talking pictures, but only if proper Finesse rolls are made.;""
Phantasmal troupe;Cr;Im;"";"15";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"1";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 change at command, +1 intricacy;Creates illusionary music from a direction that the caster specifies. A full troupe of musicians can be simulated in this way, with a finesse roll determining the quality of the music. Aurulentus uses this spell to amuse his wife and children. It was originally invented by his parens, Altus, with the same motivation.;Magi of Hermes, 22
Locus of the literatus;Cr;Im;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch;With this spell, the caster creates a drawing of his location as a vestige, illuminated on a page inside a book that he carries with him. By casting this spell in several different places, the caster produces a map that may be used with InIm spells to travel more easily through the Magic Realm.;Realms of Power – Magic, 27
Phantasmal animal;Cr;Im;"";"20";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 move under your command) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 14;Creates an image of any animal or beast up to the size of a pony (Size +1). Under your direct mental command, it moves about (within range) and makes appropriate noises. You need to be able to concentrate, and be within range, whenever you wish to direct the illusion to move in some manner. If you move out of range or stop concentrating, the illusion just freezes in place. The image does smell like an animal, but it has absolutely no effect on the sense of touch. Of course, a magus may not use this spell to create the image of an animal he or she does not know exists.;""
Phantasmal fire;Cr;Im;Ignem;"20";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 for light from Ignem requisite) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 14;Makes an image of a fire (up to the size of a large campfire) that dances, illuminates, crackles, and (apparently) warms. It does not spread, burn, or protect against cold. Makes a great joke at gatherings of House Flambeau, although creating a real fire is even more popular.;""
Told story;Cr;Im;"";"20";Voice;Performance;Ind;"";"";"";Creates the images and sounds of a story sung by the bard, which change along with the story. This spell only creates a small three- dimensional stage on which the story is told, but no true persons. Scipio can sing the story displayed on the stage without losing concentration, because of his Performance Magic (Music) Virtue. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Performance +2 changing images, +1 intricacy);Magi of Hermes, 124
Veneficus enigma;Cr;Im;"";"20";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"";"";Developed as a quick game for magi, the Veneficus Enigma creates the illusion of a small puzzlebox in the palm of the caster’s hand that can be manipulated by another. When cast, the caster sets the puzzle for the Veneficus Enigma. The illusory box then produces lights and sounds that are clues on how to open it. Figuring out the puzzle requires an Intelligence + Artes Liberales roll versus an Ease Factor equal to the caster’s Intelligence + Artes Liberales + 5. Traditionally, the caster holds an item in the palm of his hand when he casts this spell, to be retrieved as the “prize” when the box is opened. Removing the box from the caster’s hands to reveal the item without solving the puzzle is considered extremely impolite. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Move/Noise, +1 Intricate);Magi of Hermes, 30
Phantasm of the human form;Cr;Im;"";"25";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"2";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 move at your command, +1 intricacy) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 14;Makes an image of a clothed and equipped person that can make noise.

The first furrow guides the second;Cr;Im;Intellego;"25";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"1";+1 changes as pages turn, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 requisite;This spell lays the image of a book’s page over the top of a blank sheet, so that a scribe can trace the page’s contents. This creates identical copies of books. This is particularly useful when a book has lost a page, but can be made complete with a page copied from one of its sisters in another library. Used repeatedly over the course of a season, it can assist in the creation of copies of Hermetic books, allowing an unskilled magus to avoid the three extra botch dice for scribing without Profession: Scribe. This spell is alsoknown as The Principal Aide to the Forger’s Art.;Covenants, 97

This creates identical copies of books. Used repeatedly over the course of a season, it can assist in the creation of copies of Hermetic books, allowing an unskilled magus to copy books even without having the Profession: Scribe Ability. (Note: this spell’s description has been modified from when it first appeared in Covenants, page 97, where it erroneously implies that a magus without Profession: Scribe has a –3 penalty to any totals requiring that Ability);Transforming Mythic Europe, 100
Cage of bronze;Cr;Im;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a big bronze cage around the target, capturing it (if a targeting Finesse roll succeeds).;Magi of Hermes, 124
Phantasmal horse;Cr;Im;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a magical and beautiful riding horse. Due to their faerie nature, such horses are always strangely colored or behave in some other ridiculous way. Scipio’s horses are always red and curious. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 moving parts);Magi of Hermes, 124
Raise the veronese flag;Cr;Im;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"2";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 movement and complexity;This spell creates the illusion of ten Veronese men-at-arms manning the castle walls. Each soldier moves and speaks (though they seem to have Veronese accents, they form no intelligible words) but never strays from its post. Using this spell, the Veronese magi fooled the Milanese force into thinking that all of the castle walls were protected.;Lords of Men, 116

The spell can only be used by a spiritual traveler; since he is in dream, the spell can in fact be a spontaneous ritual — but it must use real-world vis, either on the caster’s body, accessible through the Arcane Connection from dreamer to body, or brought in by a physical traveler.The real-world vis must be either Creo or Imaginem vis, or theForm of the real-world object created. The caster’s score in the real-world Form determines the number of pawns of Form vis his body can use, limited in this ritual by his score in Imaginem as if a requisite on the realworld Form.A copy of the object given substance appears by the side of the entranced body of the magus casting this ritual.";The Mysteries, 109
To mark with umbrage;Cr;Im;"";"30";Sight;Sun;Group;"";"1";+3 Sight, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 size;This spell marks every member in a force mundanes, so that, in the confusion of battle, they can tell friend from foe. The mark is a large visual representation of the sigil of the magus. The spell’s creator had a shadowy sigil, so the grogs she marked appeared dark and featureless, giving the spell its name. The spell can be cast on any group of people, and can project any sort of visual mark, so Tremere magi also use it for processions and sport.Any Awareness roll concerning the location of forces has a +3 bonus while this spell is in effect. Examples include selecting areas of the battlefield to target with destructive spells, selecting victims for missile fire, finding groups to rally to when separated from the army in the swirl of battle.This version of the spell is able to mark up to a thousand individuals, in groups within the magus’s Sight. Some younger magi prefer a version of the spell suited for smaller units of grogs. This version is level 25, is effective to Voice range, and can only affect a group of about ten. Others don’t bother because grogs from House covenants usually have a covenant symbol (called a badge) or color on their clothes.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 140
Eternal repetition in a bottomless pool;Cr;Im;"";"35";Arc;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";This spell uses enchanted mirrors to display the text of a book to which the magus has an Arcane Connection. The magus commanding the mirror can navigate the book by vocal command. For example, “next page” and “the first bit about marsh fronds “ are both legitimate commands. The spell’s name is a vestige of the early order, when mirrors were more expensive and the spell was enchanted into clay vessels, read by pouring black ink into them. (Base 1, +4 Arcane Connection, +2 Sun, +1 clear words, +2 accepts commands, +1 extremely intricate);Covenants, 101
Haunt of the living ghost;Cr;Im;Intellego;"35";Arc;Conc;Ind;"";"";"";With this spell, you can instantly project your own image and voice to any designated spot that you have an Arcane Connection to (though storyguides may wish to limit this range to some absolute distance like 300 miles). You can see and hear through the image. The image must appear in some medium, such as a fire, mirror, or pool. Some magi use this spell to attend intercovenant councils without traveling the intervening distance. Because other magi can see you, this spell is not held to constitute scrying by magic. Using it through another covenant’s Aegis counts as showing off, however. (Base 2, +4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration, +2 move at your command, +1 intricacy, +1 Intellego requisite);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 144
Story of legend;Cr;Im;"";"35";Voice;Performance;Group;"";"2";+2 Voice, +1 Performance, +2 Group, +1 size, +2 changing images, +1 intricacy;This spell is similar to Told Story, but instead of creating a small stage as an Individual, this spell can create up to 100 persons or things like clouds, small dragons, and so on.;Magi of Hermes, 124
Doppelganger;Cr;Im;Mentem;"40";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Mentem requisite, +1 copy of someone, +1 moving parts;This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a person’s doppelganger, with some limited freedom and simulated intellect. It may act independently but is under the caster’s control. Like all Glamour spells, the doppelganger has substance and can act as something that really exists.;Magi of Hermes, 124
Image of the lady;Cr;Im;Mentem;"40";Touch;Ring;Ind;"";"";"";Similar to Book of Images and the spell The Shadow of Human Life (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 144) this spell creates an image of a person, which can also make sounds, within a ring that serves as a frame. This image has limited freedom and a simulated intellect. He or she cannot learn Abilities, but can remember a story told while casting the spell. Such an image can also work as a guard or similar. In Scipio’s home covenant these pictures hang on almost every wall, working as advisors for slow grogs, as monitors in the kitchens, or as sentries. Due to experimentation, Scipio’s version of this spell creates images that need to sleep and eat illusionary meals. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 intricacy, +6 Mentem requisite, for a very elaborate effect);Magi of Hermes, 124
The shadow of human life;Cr;Im;Mentem;"40";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 intricacy, +6 Mentem requisite, for a very elaborate effect;The human image created (as in Phantasm of the Human Form) has limited freedom and simulated intellect.

Garden of eden;Cr;Im;"";"45";Voice;Conc;Part;"";"10";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 Part, +1 size, +2 extremely beautiful and detailed surroundings;This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a nearly perfect world around the caster, in which everything is so beautiful that it almost hurts the eye. Most human beings, many animals, and even some faeries lose any desire to fightor argue. While casting, the magus makes a Finesse roll, the result of which is the Ease Factor of a Personality Trait roll to resist this effect. Appropriate Personality Traits would be anger, hatred, violent, and so on. This spell needs to Penetrate to work.;Magi of Hermes, 125
The shroud cut of winter’s cloth;Cr;Im;Mentem;"45";Touch;Year;Bound;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +4 Year, +4 Boundary, +1 Mentem Req.) Source: Dies Irae, 6;Similar to The Shrouded Glen (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 152), this spell enchants the Boundary in which the ritual is cast so that anyone moving through it is not only subtly diverted, but believes the space within the Boundary is filled with the image of the terrain of the caster’s choice, usually identical to the area surrounding it. This image affects the senses of sight, touch, and hearing.Intellego Imaginem Spells GENERAL;""
Discern images of truth and falsehood;In;Im;"";Gen;Per;Conc;Vision;"";effect;+1 Concentration;You can tell whether an image has been created or altered through a spell, seeing both the original and false images in the case of alterations. Illusions caused by a spell with a level higher than five lower than the level of this spell are not discerned. If you botch the roll, you mistake illusions for the real thing and reality for illusion. Your discernment is not limited to visual illusions, although you can only tell that a sound is illusory if you are looking at the apparent source.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 144
The discerning eye;In;Im;"";Gen;Per;Sun;Vision;"";"";"";An enhanced version of Discern the Images of Truth and Falsehood. You can tell whether an image has been created or altered by magic, seeing both the original and false images in the case of alterations. The enhanced sense works by extromission (sending magical species from the eyes). If these encounter any Magic Resistance, they may be blocked. Therefore an area protected by Magic Resistance will appear dark to the magical aspect of the caster’s vision. When cast without Penetration the caster is able to spot areas of Magic Resistance (which would include an invisible magus). To detect an illusion this spell must be at least fifteen levels higher than the effect that generated it. However, use of the Acute Sense mastery ability may still detect an anomaly. If you botch the spell, you mistake illusions for the real thing and reality for illusion. Your discernment is not limited to visual illusions, although you can only tell that a sound is illusory if you are looking at the apparent source.(Base, +2 Sun, +1 Enhanced Effect);Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 72
Fingers for eyes;In;Im;"";"5";Touch;Diam;Room;"";"1";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +2 Room;The caster can see the Room that the person he touches is in. The spell can be used by a blind magus to “see,” by moving around with his hand on the shoulder of a servant. It can also be used to see the location that an Intangible Tunnel-style effect terminates in.This spell only works if the person touched is actually in a Room. This spell must Penetrate in order to sense creatures with Magic Resistance.;Hermetic Projects, 84

The brushstrokes revealed;In;Im;"";"10";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;This spell makes the species cast by an object within the circle more vivid, so that the magus can see tiny details that are otherwise invisible. This spell has traditionally been used to investigate the physical construction of artworks, but nature-oriented Jerbiton magi have recently begun using it to investigate the handiwork of God, by examining the tiny structures of creation.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 65
The copyist’s critical eye;In;Im;"";"10";Per;Conc;Vision;"";"1";+1 Concentration, +4 Vision;The caster casts his eye over two texts, and he can immediately see the places in the second that differ from the first by perfecting his memory of the first text. The manner in which the differences are displayed depend on the caster’s sigil. To Atrox of Tytalus, any incorrect words appear to be drawn in fresh blood.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 101
An ear for distant bells;In;Im;"";"15";Per;Conc;Hearing;"";"";"";This spell allows the caster to precisely determine the distance and direction from their location to the source of a sound.

Hearing the silent chorus;In;Im;"";"15";Per;Conc;Hearing;"";"3";+1 Concentration, +3 Hearing;"This spell allows the recipient to barely hear the unheard sounds of the planetary orbits. Interpreting the sounds depends upon the listener, whose player makes an Intelligence + Artes Liberales + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 12. If successful, the player gains a +3 to the next astrology roll her character makes, or +3 to the next song the character composes. If the roll botches, the listener gains a Warping Point per zero on the botch dice. This spell only affects the specified astrology activity or song composition once; repeated castings for that activity are not effective.";Art & Academe, 16

The scrying pool;In;Im;"";"20";Arc;Conc/Special;Ind;Ritual;Effect;non-Hermetic;"This ritual allows the caster to see an image of the target and his immediate surroundings in the surface of the pool of water in the Scrying Office (in the Basillica). The ritual is specifically designed for this pool; another similar pool cannot be used.If Wizard’s Communion is used to cast this ritual, then it only expires when all of the casting magi cease to concentrate. Individual magi may cease concentrating and rejoin later. In this way, by taking shifts, the ritual may be prolonged for hours, days, potentially even years. Only magi who participated in the Wizard’s Communion may join or rejoin the ritual. This effect is a special feature of how this ritual was originally designed to interact with Wizard’s Communion; these rules do not apply to other spells.Casting this spell on a member of Order of Hermes is illegal scrying.

To see as though a plethron distant;In;Im;"";"25";Sight;Conc;Special;"";"2";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +3 Special target based on Room +1;This spell allows the caster to see and hear his surroundings as though he was standing in another place he can naturally see. The spell does not enhance the caster’s natural sight or hearing.The caster has some freedom to move his vantage point, but cannot move into any place that he cannot naturally see from his physical location. Moving the viewpoint requires a Simple Stamina + Concentration Roll vs. Ease Factor 6.The “plethron” of the spell title is a Greek measurement roughly equivalent to 100 feet, although the spell’s range allows for a potentially greater distance.Petalichus and his brother Cononites have investigated this spell, as Petalichus had anticipated that he would be able to use it to gain sight of new viable targets. This proved not to be the case. William Bonisagi theorized that the species, recreated as they are, bear insufficient connection to the things they represent to support casting spells against them. By being so far removed, the magus would essentially be attempting to cast his spells on mere apparitions.However, using this spell to aid with Hermetic Geometry spells (those using Arcane Line, Arcane Circle, and Arcane Ring) reduces the Distance Level by 1 if the caster can now see his target. This is cumulative with other spells or devices that may also reduce the Distance Level (see The Worldly Halysis later).The Target is based on Room, but is more complex as it allows unbounded spaces to be targeted. Any area comparable to Room can be targeted.;Magi of Hermes, 101

The clandestine mask;Mu;Im;"";"4";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";"This spell blurs the face and distorts the voice of the caster, so that she may not be recognized by anyone who knows her. The caster’s sigil determines what form this disguise takes; Carolus of Tytalus, whose sigil is darkness, has his face cast perpetually in shadow and his voice echoing and deep. Harpax, whose sigil is multiplicity, acquires a new face every few seconds, and his voice changes randomly between accents and pitches. A magus with a particularly obvious sigil must create a more powerful version (+1 magnitude for higher complexity) to blur this distinction further.

Voice of the leucrota;Mu;Im;"";"4";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"1";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;The target’s voice is changed so that it is wholly different. This can duplicate the voice of a specific person known to the caster, or a particular accent he has heard before, or simply change the voice to be different than the target’s own. This spell does not allow the target to speak a language that she does not know. An Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 can accurately replicate an accent, and a 9 is needed to duplicate a specific voice. Someone more familiar with the person mimicked may still perpetrate the falsehood. This is also Persephone’s favored spell used to humiliate an opponent she has bested in certamen — she often gives them an unnaturally squeaky or basso profundo voice. A leucrota is a mythical beast that can mimic the voices of men to lure them as prey.;Magi of Hermes, 91
A visible demand for repair;Mu;Im;"";"5";Touch;Ring;Circ;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;This spell transforms the groans and squeaks of damaged pieces of equipment into iconic species reminiscent of the magus’s sigil.

Confound the rival singer;Mu;Im;"";"5";Sight;Conc;Ind;"";"1";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration;A somewhat mischievous spell, Yestin devised this in order to give himself an unfair advantage over his mundane rivals. The target of the spell is a singer’s voice (or the sound produced by a single musical instrument), and the spell allows the caster to pull that voice in all manner of directions. For example, it pulls notes higher, pushes them lower, draws them out longer, or cuts them off sharply.As the caster must anticipate the music or song as it is being performed, the spell requires a Finesse roll to affect the sound to a greater or lesser degree. On a high Finesse roll (9 or higher), the caster is able to change words within the song, or change entire chords within the music. At the lowest level, the caster is able to at least change some of the music to bad notes or add a croak in the voice.Finesse Roll: 3+Effect: Causes occasional breaks in the voice or the random bador missed note.Finesse Roll: 6+Effect: The caster can choose to manipulate the performance suchthat it appears to simply be a good player on a bad night. The target voice might sound strained or croaky, and instruments may sound in need of tuning.Finesse Roll: 9+Effect: The caster can make the singer sound tone deaf, flatteninga performance or pitching the music off key.Finesse Roll: 12+Effect: The caster achieves a fine level of control, and can evenchange words within a song to any other words of his choosing.If the caster is familiar with the song or the piece of music, he may add his Music score to his Finesse roll as there is less need to anticipate the performance.It may be possible to apply the spell to the spoken word, perhaps to an orator or a tutor as he addresses an audience, although Yestin has not yet experimented with this.;Magi of Hermes, 140

Comeliness of the crone;Mu;Im;"";"10";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;The target appears less likeable, cute, and attractive. Numerous subtle changes in appearance bring about this change, including a shriller, higher pitched voice, a more crooked posture, and a slightly more bloated and unclean face and figure. The character gets a –3 modifier on all rolls to influence, seduce, or please others. Aurulentus used this spell on his daughters to test whether their suitors were really more interested in personality than looks as they usually proclaimed. He stopped using it after his wife found out and forbade it. He now uses the Bachelor’s Door (see Enchanted Items) to test suitors of his daughters — without the knowledge of his wife.;Magi of Hermes, 22
Notes of a delightful sound;Mu;Im;"";"10";Touch;Sun;Room;"";"";"";Causes all sounds in a room, particularly music, to be especially clear and sonorous. The notes are clearer, sharper, and more distinct. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Room);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 145
Safeguard the clandestine conversation;Mu;Im;Rego;"10";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Ring, +1 requisite;"The visual and auditory species produced by anyone within the circle drawn by the caster as he casts the spell are muddled to any observers who were not present in the circle at the time of casting; this includes those scrying on the target from a remote location. Those inside the circle can still see and hear each other normally, due to the Rego requisite that causes the spell to only affect the species streaming in certain directions. The nature of the muddled images varies according to the design of the spell, but usually includes the inventor’s sigil, and leaves those within unidentifiable by their appearance or sound.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 98
Aura of the simple bard;Mu;Im;"";"15";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";Alters the appearance of a person to make him look more innocent and trustworthy. His facial features become softer and more childish. The character receives a +3 on appropriate rolls. This doesn’t undo the effects of The Gift (see page 75 of Ars Magica Fifth Edition), but works well for magi who have the Gentle Gift. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun);Magi of Hermes, 125
Disguise of the transformed image;Mu;Im;"";"15";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;Makes someone look, sound, feel, and smell different, though at least passably human.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 146
Sight of the warm surface;Mu;Im;"";"15";Touch;Conc;Vision;"";"2";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +4 Vision;Although Imaginem magic cannot create heat, warm surfaces emit species, which humans can sense through touch. This spell transforms those into species that the eye responds to. How the warmth is seen varies by magus.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 65
The petrine deception;Mu;Im;"";"15";Voice;Conc;Group;"";"";"";This spell makes Alexander’s grogs look and sound like small rocks. Alexander is unable to dispel his magic, and while in rock form his grogs cannot communicate with each other to co-ordinate attacks, so this spell dissipates when Alexander’s concentration wavers. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Group);Magi of Hermes, 14
Ball of abysmal music;Mu;Im;Vim;"20";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice;This spell targets a formulaic Ignem spell while it is being cast, changing it so that instead of creating fire, heat, or light, it produces a harmless burst of color and sound. This was reputedly Pendule’s favorite spell, and he taught it to all of his Merinita followers after Initiating them into the Inner Mystery of Glamour. Note that since the spell must be fast-cast, it cannot be cast formulaically unless it has been mastered for that purpose.;Houses of Hermes – Mystery Cults, 90
Glowing footprints of the thief;Mu;Im;"";"20";Sight;Conc;Group;"";"2";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;This spell makes the traces of sweat left by a person visible, by transforming the stream of olfactory species of the person’s scent into a stream of iconic species. The way this light appears is dependent on the sigil and Finesse of the magus. This spell is mimetic, so all nearby people can see the scent traces. Note that to cast this spell, the magus must be distinctly aware of the scent of the thief, so that there is a valid target for the spell.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 65
Image phantom;Mu;Im;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;Any one thing, including a living thing, can be made to appear as if it were something else of approximately the same shape and size. The illusion cannot be cast on things that have a shape or size improper to the final appearance. If the target moves or is moved in such a way that the illusion is inappropriate, it looks very strange indeed.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 146

Living fire;Mu;Im;"";"25";Voice;Fire;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +3 Fire, +1 moving images;This spell alters the image, sound, and smell of campfire or bonfire to something the caster chooses, such as a dancing woman or a dragon’s head. The real flame is not changed, so you won’t be burned by the parts of the image that extend outside of it, like the flaming breath of the dragon’s head.;Magi of Hermes, 125
Ogre’s stench;Mu;Im;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"1";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 size, +2 very “detailed” smell;You change the targets’ smell (up to 100 people) in such a disgusting and awful way that they and every person near them must make Stamina rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 or act with a –3 penalty to all rolls. If they botch, they throw up.;Magi of Hermes, 125
A house already abandoned;Mu;Im;"";"35";Touch;Moon;Str;"";"3";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +3 Structure, +1 Complexity) Source: Dies Irae, 7;From outside the structure, the targeted structure appears empty and crumbling, and there are no signs of movement inside. Anyone within the structure seems to be nothing more than a scurrying insect, and any furnishings seem to be rubble. The sounds, sights, and smells of anyone inside are masked and hidden.;""
Servant of fire;Mu;Im;Ignem, Mentem;"45";Voice;Fire;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice, +3 Fire, +1 Mentem requisite, +1 moving parts;This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) turns a normal fire into a human servant. He has a simple intellect and is good for only simple tasks, but has no possibility of learning or free will. The servant must eat a lot of wood or other flammable materials, otherwise the fire will burn out, ending the spell. As long as the servant eats enough, however, the spell continues. This spell has a minor side effect from experimentation that makes the servant sing instead of speaking normally.GENERAL;Magi of Hermes, 125

Hiding in the crowd;Pe;Im;"";"10";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 Sun;This spell makes the caster selectively invisible. It destroys a thin cone of the species the magus emits, so that a single person cannot see the caster. People around the magus, who are outside the cone, continue to see the caster. This is particularly useful in city crowds, because it stops the magus being buffeted by oblivious passersby. Note that this spell only works if the magus knows the location of the single viewer to be excluded, and if the viewer moves predictably. If the viewer moves rapidly out of the cone, the magus becomes visible to him.The transparency requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to be convincing, if the target remains stationary. If the target is moving slowly and predictably, as, for example, a sentry on a route or a pedestrian strolling to a gate, this increases to 9. It increases to 15 for a character moving very swiftly but predictably, for example, a horseman following a road.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 64
Illusion of cool flames;Pe;Im;"";"10";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"2";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;A source of heat, such as a fire, seems to lose its heat and drop to the surrounding temperature. It still, however, has its normal beneficial and harmful effects (that is, glowing coals still cook meat or burn a person’s hand, though they do not feel hot).;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 146
Quell the scent;Pe;Im;"";"10";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;Destroys the target’s scent. This is very useful for stalking animals (and other creatures) that rely on smell. Add +3 to Stealth rolls in such circumstances.;Through the Aegis, 81
Snatched voice;Pe;Im;"";"10";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"";"";The target loses the ability to make sound. If she is a maga and attempts to cast spells, she suffers the penalties for silent casting. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +1 changing image);Hermetic Projects, 85
Chamber of muffled passing;Pe;Im;"";"15";Touch;Diam;Room;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +2 Room;For the duration of two minutes, all sound inside the affected Room, regardless of its origin and volume, is completely muted. The spell affects mundane actions, such as creaking floor boards or shouting, in much the same way as spell casting that requires a voice.Due to his Quiet Magic, this limitation doesn’t impair Tolides much, unless he wants to cast an additional spell with Range Voice while inside the Room, or to affect a target across the threshold. In Tolides’ version of the spell, the affected Room is slightly tainted by darkness. Semi-translucent patches of murk slowly crawl along the walls of the Room, greedily devouring all sound from within or outside. Tolides is not very creative when it comes to finding names for his creations, and doesn’t care much about the ambiguous name of this spell that also describes the silenced deaths of those in the chamber whom Tolides decides to kill.;Magi of Hermes, 133
Hiding the ill-bred bard;Pe;Im;"";"15";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 Sun, +1 changing image;Destroys the magus’ image species and makes him invisible except for his shadow.;Magi of Hermes, 125
Invisibility of the standing wizard;Pe;Im;"";"15";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;The target becomes invisible, but the spell is broken if he moves (aside from breathing and shifting slightly in place). He still casts a shadow.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 146
Ambush on the deserted road;Pe;Im;"";"20";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;This spell destroys all of the species that the group of things within the Circle emit in a single direction. It can — for example — make a magus’s traveling party invisible from the direction of another group they wish to ambush. The base level of this spell includes an adjustment that accounts for the magus’s ability to gently move the direction of effect, so that as the enemy group passes by, they cannot spot the hidden party. Other people, for example the members of the magus’s company, can still see each other, because the species reaching their eyes are unobstructed. The transparency requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to be convincing.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 64
Ears of a grateful father;Pe;Im;"";"20";Touch;Conc;Group;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Group, +1 changing images;All voices emitted by a group of individuals will be decreased in volume to that of a normal conversation.

The circle prevents iconic and echoic species from leaving the circle, making the encampment undetectable. Perfect for ensuring privacy in unfamiliar territories, it does leave the camp as a silent black area; this is normally enough at night, when everything is dark, and Conscientia does not see the need for additional illusions.";Magi of Hermes, 30

Wizard’s sidestep;Re;Im;"";"10";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";Your image appears up to 1 pace from where you actually are, so attacks aimed there are likely to miss you. Whenever the image is successfully struck, it disappears and reappears in another spot. In combat, early attacks are aimed at the image, and so automatically miss you. Once the image has been hit once, you have a +9 bonus to Defense, as attackers must try to find you in a fairly large area.

Color explosion;Re;Im;"";"15";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"1";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 fast moving image, +1 change with movements;The image of the spell’s target seems to explode in a great whirlwind of colors and fragments of the original image. The explosion has a radius of two paces for a human with Size 0, changing appropriately for targets of different Sizes. This makes the target effectively invisible as far as combat is concerned, and no visual clues to his precise location can be picked out of the chaos. For rules for fighting an invisible enemy see Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 32-33. This spell is best used with Discern Own Illusions.;Magi of Hermes, 125

Confusion of the insane vibrations;Re;Im;"";"30";Touch;Conc;Vision;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +4 Vision, +1 additional senses;The target of the spell sees everything vibrate back and forth at varying high speeds. In addition, sounds and scents are displaced and seem to come from the wrong areas. Anyone trying to fight in these circumstances suffers –3 on Attack and Defense scores, and must roll two extra botch dice. The target is likely to become desperate and terribly confused. Navigation is exceedingly difficult. The visual effects of this spell are negated if the target is in complete darkness or if they close their eyes.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 147
Image from the wizard torn;Re;Im;Intellego;"30";Per;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+1 Concentration, +1 additional sense, +1 Intellego requisite;Your image separates from your body and moves as you do. It can speak whatever you say and do so in your voice, and you can see through its eyes. You must make an Int + Concentration stress roll for each solid object the image passes through and for each mile it travels. If you wish the image to be able to leave your sight, you must use an Arcane Connection to yourself (for example, a fingernail or a lock of hair) when you cast the spell. That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located. As your image is away from your body, you are invisible and silent at your actual location. The image is your image, so while you may move it in space you may not have it sit down if you are standing. Further, it appears as if illuminated by whatever light is falling on you, no matter what the level of illumination is at the image.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 147
Summon the spirit of illusion;Re;Im;"";"40";Arc;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration;Calls a disembodied Imaginem spirit if the magus has an Arcane Connection or knows the non-magical name of the spirit.

By his works;Cr;Me;"";"5";Per;Conc;Ind;"";"";"";"Refreshes a specific memory within the mind of the caster; as long as some fragment of it remains, this spell will restore it. Once refreshed, the caster can hold the perfected memory as long he concentrates. Studying the memory effectively creates a new one which does not fade when the spell expires. This spell was created to allow Quaesitors to perfectly recall spell sigils they encounter. The spell can be used to recall other details of a brief event, like faces or voices.

Look at me;Cr;Me;"";"15";Sight;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+3 Sight;This spell creates a thought in the imagination of the target, causing him to look directly at the caster even if the caster has not been previously noticed by the target. This glance is sufficient to make eye contact. If concentrating on another task, the target may make a Stamina + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist. This spell is most often cast with no voice or gestures as a subtle way of attracting someone’s attention.;Art & Academe, 32

Rising passion;Cr;Me;"";"15";"Eye;";Sun,;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;Raises an unnatural carnal lust in a target. The target has no control over his or her passion, and is likely to act inappropriately.;Guardians of the Forest, 73
The welcome stranger;Cr;Me;"";"15";Eye;Diam;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +1 Diameter;This spell inserts a recollection of the caster into the target’s memory. The memory itself soon fades, but its fleeting presenceis usually enough to reassure the target that he has met the caster before.The nature and context of the memory is determined when the spell is cast.Even fond or favorable memories are not enough to counteract the effects of The Gift, but the guidelines in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 76, give an idea how the memory of an established relationship influences behavior.In later years, Yestin mastered this spell such that he can cast it both quietly and without the normal Hermetic gestures.;Magi of Hermes, 140

As ritual Creo magic, the locus becomes a natural, permanent part of the target’s memory, which remains after the spell ends.This ritual may create loci outside and above the normal limit of five per room, number of rooms limited to Art of Memory score; for example, the locus may stand in a normal room, but obviously distinct from the others, or may have a new room created for it, away from the “courtyard.” Count magically-created and normally- memorized rooms and loci separately from each other.";The Mysteries, 27
Convince a man he has an enemy;Cr;Me;"";"20";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +3 Moon;This spell convinces the target that he has an enemy, selected at the time of the casting. The target does not remember why the selected person is his enemy and naturally assumes that the origin of the dispute happened long ago. This spell does not dictate a target’s response to his enemy, but merely installs the notion of enmity in the target’s mind.;Tales of Power, 13
Creation of an undeserved reputation;Cr;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell creates the memory that a certain person has confessed to having an extremely enjoyable evening of intercourse with another person. The second person may be named, if the magus wishes, or, with a penalty of 3 on the Finesse roll, merely suggested so that the target of the spell draws his own conclusions.When the Duration expires, the details of the episode vanish, but the character remembers recalling them. This means the character may not be able to remember where or when the confession was made, but remembers that it was. If pressed, the character starts to infer the context of the memory, which then becomes more solid with each recollection.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 70
Creation of the simile;Cr;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell creates a new category of thing in the mind of the viewer, granting unconscious familiarity with a broad range of instances of that thing. Alternatively, the spell may be used to grant a broad knowledge of a category of thing of which the target is already aware. A magus deeply familiar with a simile, as described earlier, may make the target deeply familiar with the simile, while a magus only broadly familiar with a simile may only create broad familiarity in the target.This spell is usually created with a long Range and Duration, because it allows the magus to create unreal similes in the minds of hostile targets. This is most effective when the target does not already have a ready category for the thing the magus wishes to hide. As an example, a magus carting odd spell components into a city may convince the guards that they are “geegaws,” or some other meaningless category, and thus unimportant. This will not work if the guard already has a simile that includes things that look like spell components, for example “tools of the Devil.”;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 69
Defend me;Cr;Me;"";"20";Eye;Conc;Group;"";"4";+1 Eye, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;Plants the suggestion into the mind of the target group that Lucia must be defended from harm. In most cases this is even enough to prompt enemies to come to her defense. Those under the spell must make a Personality Check against Ease Factor 9 to take any detrimental action against Lucia. Her Venus’ Blessing Virtue provides a –3 penalty to any such rolls.;Tales of Power, 116
Enhance the memory palace;Cr;Me;"";"20";Per;Moon;Ind;"";"";"";This spell magically constructs an extremely detailed locus in the caster’s memory palace. The subject of the locus must be observed while the spell is being cast. The subject can be a single object, all the objects in a particular location, a discrete scene or event, or any written material less than a complete text. While the spell lasts, the caster can recall even obscure details by spending several minutes in reflection, “exploring” the locus. Multiple instances of this spell cannot be cast on the same subject. For example, a magus cannot use Enhance the Memory Palace to memorize an entire text by casting the spell on one page at a time. The locus can be destroyed with Perdo Mentem magic. When the spell ends, so does the memory. The magus may permanently memorize the information by spending seven days in meditation and succeeding in a roll of Intelligence + Art of Memory vs. an Ease Factor of 9 (Average). There is also a Ritual version of this spell, which creates a permanent memory locus.Magically created loci may exceed the limit on loci in memory: count them separately from normal loci. However, if the caster wishes to permanently memorize the locus to last beyond the spell, it must fall within all normal limits.(base 5, +3 Moon);The Mysteries, 26
Gossip of the marketplace;Cr;Me;Rego;"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";Implants a piece of information in a target, who is then compelled to pass this information on to his friends until the duration expires.

Memory of the distant dream;Cr;Me;"";"20";"Eye;";Sun,;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;Inserts a full and complete memory into a person’s mind.

Orpheus’ ballad;Cr;Me;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Group;"";"4";+2 Voice, +2 Group;"The spell creates a momentary flash of intense unnatural fear, despair, and woe in the minds of the assailants, attacking their estimation (Art & Academe, page 32). Each target in turn, starting from the target closest to the caster, attempts a Brave Personality Roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or flees the scene. This roll is modified by –1 for each other member of the group who fails his roll; the more who flee, the less resolve the others have.The magic of the spell is carried on the caster’s own scream, and extends out as far as the caster’s voice would normally carry at a high volume (in excess of 50 paces). The magic of the spell affects the group of individuals in front of and closest to the caster. The individuals must still constitute a group as per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 113.Yestin devised the spell after he was set upon by brigands along the road from Winchester to the Isle of Oxney near Rye. He was lucky to escape their clutches after their first meeting, and ensured that he was prepared for their next.The spell is named for all the grief suffered by Orpheus, who lost so much on leaving the underworld.";Magi of Hermes, 140

The far-speaking voice;Cr;Me;"";"20";Arc;Diam;Ind;"";"3";+4 Arcane Connection, +1 Diam;The caster can deliver two minutes of conversation directly into the mind of the person to whom he holds an Arcane Connection, although the target cannot communicate back. This spell is often placed within an enchantment (either a charged item or one with an effect which expires) with the caster’s own Arcane Connection, allowing a spy to communicate with him.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 97
The roar that induces terror;Cr;Me;"";"20";Per;Diam;Sound;"";"4";Diameter +1, Spectacle +3;The victims of this spell are overcome with a terrible fear of the source of the roar, and attempt to retreat from it. In Lexora’s version, as they hear the roar they also subtly feel the heat of the sun upon their skins.;Through the Aegis, 43
The subtle burn of desire;Cr;Me;"";"20";Eye;Moon;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye, +3 Moon;This spell instills in the target a simmering physical desire for one person, most often Lucia herself. This gives the target a temporary Personality Trait “Desire for Lucia” at +2, which influences the target’s behavior throughout the spell’s duration.;Tales of Power, 117
A night’s passion;Cr;Me;"";"25";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +3 Moon;Usually cast upon a sleeping target, often slumbering due to Lucia’s Call to Slumber spell, this spell creates the lasting memory of a nightlong sexual encounter with Lucia, the content of which is decided by Lucia at the time of casting, though her target is free to embellish or exaggerate upon the memory in due course. Targets who make an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 realize the memory is false, but those already under another of Lucia’s lasting enchantments have a –3 penalty to this roll. Once cast, the memory remains for Moon duration, long enough for the memory to settle and fade, making the loss of it less jarring. She has used this spell on Federico many times, and if the player characters detect, and understand, it they may come to wonder whether she has ever actually slept with him.One drawback to this spell is that it is an active magical effect, detectable to those using Intellego Vim spells.;Tales of Power, 117
Human figment of the waking mind;Cr;Me;"";"25";Eye;Conc;Ind;"";"3";+1 Eye, +1 Concentration, +1 for two sensory species, +2 move at command, +1 intricacy;This spell places a hallucinatory person in the mind of another through the common sense. No one else can see or hear the person seen and heard by the target. The caster determines what the hallucination looks like, and can cause it to act in the way he wishes by concentrating. He cannot, however, see it himself.;Art & Academe, 32
Memory palace of the sage;Cr;Me;"";"25";Per;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"";"";Creates a locus for the contents of an entire text in the target’s memory palace. Once the locus is in place, the magus can recite the entire text and replicate any illustrations. Perdo Mentem magic can destroy this locus. As with Constructing the Memory Palace, a magical locus may exceed the normal locus-count limit.As the spell is cast, the magus magically reads through the book, reading the entire text (no matter the length) in the exact time it takes to cast the spell. The pages seem to rustle by as if caught in the wind. Once memorized, the magus does not require an actual copy of the text to study or transcribe it.The Library of Durenmar is permanently enchanted to prevent this Ritual from being performed within its walls, although only the Primus of the House knows how this was achieved. Additionally, rumors exist of texts that contain traps against such memorization, even fatal ones, and of the dangers of memorizing a text written by an incomprehensible Criamon or an author close to Final Twilight.

My new best friend;Cr;Me;Muto;"25";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";"This spell causes the target to believe that the caster is an old friend. The spell actually causes the caster to be temporarily substituted for one of the target’s real friends, adding realism; which means that the target will not suspect something is wrong, nor concentrate on the substitution unduly. Additionally, once the spell has expired, the target will not necessarily realize that he has been duped. The target will have one pivotal memory about the caster, usually (but not always) about how they became friends; and a host of supporting memories of minor events. Note that the caster does not know the memories that will be replaced, but can be assured of a friendly reaction (the target acquires a ‘Friendly to Caster’ Personality Trait at +3). Only if the target is a misanthrope with no good friends will the memories be entirely false, in which case the target gets an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to reveal the memory as false.Henri’s sigil, which reflects his trading interests, tends to create a memory associated with a business partner or a former transaction.

This comes in handy when you need the local plebs to believe … well, anything.Conspicuous effects are also more likely to be accepted when the populous thinks of them as miracles rather than spells. However, caution is advised so as not to attract too much attention from the church, or indeed, from demons.Note that all Mythic Europeans know that the devil can masquerade as an angel of light; if a Gifted individual serves as the spokesperson during the effect of this spell, that is almost certainly what the audience will believe.";""

The subject is asked to recall some event within the day in question as the spell is cast. Events that day are remembered as if they had occurred only an hour before. Depending on how long ago the day was, any particular event may have completely disappeared, depending on how memorable the event was. Thus some details may be recalled perfectly and others will be entirely missing.";Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 73
The ob of mot;Cr;Me;"";"25";Veil;Conc;Group;"";"";"";"Special: Requires Canaanite Magic VirtueThis spell allows those about the caster to speak with a specific person in the world of the dead — to them it appears that the caster is speaking with the voice of the dead person. The caster is effectively acting as a temporary container or vessel for the dead spirit, and botches of this spell might cause the caster to become possessed by a malevolent spirit.The caster must either have an Arcane Connection to, or otherwise be able to sense, the target, and the target must be in the world of the dead; that is, neither alive nor in Heaven. The dead person is compelled neither to speak nor be truthful.

To sing of good meat and drink;Cr;Me;"";"25";Voice;Conc;Room;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Room;Yestin invented this spell in order to reward innkeepers and taverners who showed generosity to him as he explored Stonehenge and beyond. He often weaves this spell into his evening’s performance, using his Performance Magic to hide the casting within his music. It has the effect of making those in the room somewhat thirsty and hungry. Those with a Compulsion (Personality Flaw) for eating and/or drinking are powerless to resist and must eat or drink as soon as they can. Others need to make a Personality Check against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist the temptation, assuming they wish to resist it.The effect is largely gentle and is designed to go unnoticed, beyond the takings over the bar seeing a marked increase. Yestin always uses forceless casting to ensure the spell has no Penetration, and so will not affect magi.;Magi of Hermes, 141
Weight of a thousand hells;Cr;Me;"";"25";"Eye;";Moon,;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye, +3 Moon, +1 complex effect;Causes the victim to feel the despair, anguish, pain, and sorrow of a thousand sinners in Hell. This is a horrible spell, for the victim loses almost all motivation and earthly cares. All he can feel is his own pain — endless, inexorable, and searing. Appropriate Personality Trait rolls suffer a harmful adjustment of –5, and the target suffers –2 on any rolls that require thought or concentration. The target has a strong tendency to do nothing but brood.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 148
The unwelcoming room;Cr;Me;"";"30";Line;Conc;Room;"";"4";+3 Line, +1 Concentration, +2 Room;Targeted on a distant room using the Arcane Line Range, this spell induces anger in all affected targets. A stress roll using an appropriate Personality Trait (like Calm or Restrained) against an Ease Factor of 9 is required to keep the anger under control. Aggressive traits (like Argumentative, Intolerant, or Angry) work against the roll. A failure inclines the target to aggressive action against anyone or anything that could appear or feel threatening. Petalichus knows the effect The Gift has on mundanes, and recognizes that the fear and distrust it fosters in them can easily be triggered into something more dangerous. Petalichus uses this spell to heighten tensions and use them against his enemies from a position of safety.;Magi of Hermes, 101

Missive of memory;Cr;Me;"";"40";Arc;Moon;Ind;"";"5";+4 Arcane Connection, +3 Moon;This spell creates a complete memory in the mind of the target. The target retains this memory until the duration of the spell expires. After the spell expires, the target may still recall those times when he dwelt on the memory. This spell-induced memory itself is false and may be discovered as such with an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (in the same manner as a memory created by the spell Memory of the Distant Dream).Lambert frequently uses this spell for communication with distant associates (but not with magi who are, as a nearly universal rule, uncomfortable leaving Arcane Connections with others). To draw attention to the information that he wants to convey, Lambert typically creates memories for the target’s very recent past that are clearly impossible, such as a memory of the target and a talking statue having had a long conversation on a snowy mountaintop within the last ten minutes.While this spell only takes a moment to cast, the magus needs to have a clear understanding of the memory that he wants to create in his own mind before creating it in the mind of the target. If the magus is not prepared, he cannot create a complex memory lasting more than a moment, or a longer memory that contains any great detail and is not repetitive. The preparation of any complex memory takes at least as long for the magus to create as the elapsed time of the memory that is created. Lambert specifically designed Missive of Memory to not Warp his second daughter.;Magi of Hermes, 65

The faeries play at the edges of their host’s vision, apparently hiding behind things in the external world, or running quickly away whenever their hosts try to look at them directly. They appear threatening and malicious, and act as though they are flanking their targets and getting ready for an attack.Although the Target is the Group of Mentem faeries being created, they are created within the minds of a group of target individuals. As such, this spell must penetrate any Magic Resistance possessed by members of this group.A Personality Check against Ease Factor 6 is required to hold firm to the physical threat at hand rather than be distracted by these faeries. Appropriate Personality Trait should be agreed with the storyguide.;""

This Personality Trait overrides the regular rules for Prevailing Loyalty; it is not affected by living conditions or magus actions. The spell inflicts one Warping Point immediately when it first affects a character, five Warping Points over the course of the year, and five additional Warping Points for every subsequent year the character remains under its effects. After a year under the effects of this spell, each covenfolk affected will therefore have a Warping Score of 1, and acquire either the Simple-Minded or Short Attention Span Flaw as his first Minor Flaw.";Covenants, 41

Perception of the conflicting motives;In;Me;"";"15";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+1 Eye;You can detect the conflicting motives behind one target’s actions. Thus you might learn that a guard feels conflict between fear and duty. This spell is often used before application of a Muto or Rego spell, since it is usually easier to change a target’s emotions after you’ve sensed them than it is to create emotions.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 149
Anat’s search in the miry abyss;In;Me;"";"20";Veil;Diam;Ind;"";"4";+3 Veil, +1 Diam;Special: Requires Canaanite Magic VirtueThis spell senses a specific person in the world of the dead. If a person cannot be sensed, then she is either alive or beyond the reach of the spell. The only reason that a dead person would normally be beyond the reach of the spell is that she is in Heaven. Once sensed, the magus may cast other spells on the target, as long as this spell is active.;Ancient Magic, 32
Frosty breath of the spoken lie;In;Me;"";"20";Eye;Conc;Ind;"";"10";+1 Eye, +1 Concentration, mist is a purely cosmetic effect and thus is free;For as long as you maintain this spell, the target exhales a misty breath with each spoken lie. Small bits of ice form on the person’s lips if the lie is particularly severe. In winter, when breath is visible anyway, lies produce a greater than normal amount of mist (the mist actually billows out). A target who makes a Communication + Guile stress roll of 15+ can determine whether any given statement will be taken by the spell as a lie. The spell can be defeated through extensive and judicious application of Creo Auram and Perdo Auram spells, and a demon is able to manipulate it in any way it wishes, as demons are the embodiment of deception and are never caught in a lie if they do not wish to be.

Posing the silent question;In;Me;"";"20";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Eye;You can ask one silent mental question of the target, then detect the answer. The truth of the answer is limited by the knowledge of the target. Questions to the effect of “What would you do if . . . ?” often receive inaccurate replies. You are likely to get what the target thinks he would do, not necessarily what he would really do. The target of this spell does not notice the questioning unless he or she makes a Magic Resistance roll.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 149

The factor’s roll call;In;Me;"";"20";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Eye;This spell probes the mind of the target to reveal if he has ever heard a specific word. Persephone uses this spell to determine whether a given person is one of her agents — since she operates her agents remotely she instructs her factors to say an obscure word to all recruited agents. This spell therefore tells her if a person is in her employ. She has on occasion used it to discover whether her identity has been leaked. The word she most commonly uses is “shibboleth,” although theologians may have heard this wordbefore.;Magi of Hermes, 92
Music of the unwanted attention;In;Me;"";"25";Per;Mom;Hearing;"";"10";+3 Hearing;The caster is able to sense anyone who is currently aware of her. A person’s attention, regardless how fleeting, is heard as a musical chime, and each individual is represented by a different tone. She doesn’t detect any information about them other than they are aware of her existence. The information gained from this spell is only relevant for the moment that the spell is cast, and is only applicable to those who have an active interest in the caster’s presence. This spell operates by interrogating the common sense (see Art & Academe, page 33) for images of the caster.;Magi of Hermes, 92

Betraying whispers of the jealous mind;In;Me;"";"30";Per;Conc;Hearing;"";"5";+1 Concentration, +3 Hearing, +1 complexity — only detects emotions concerning the caster;"This spell allows the caster to hear the dominant emotion regarding himself from those who come within his earshot. He does not sense any emotions other than those which pertain to himself, and each emotion manifests as a muffled voice in his head, repeating again and again a word or short phrase which indicates that emotion. Thus, if his rival is jealous of his reputation, the caster might hear “Your fame should be mine” whispered over and over. The volume of the voice indicates the proximity of the emotion. By concentrating, the caster can single out one voice among any others within earshot; as the caster approaches the owner of that emotion, he hears an increase in the volume of the voice.";Houses of Hermes – Societates, 98

Familial secrets;In;Me;"";"30";Per;Mom;Bloodline,Faerie;"";"15";+3 Bloodline;By casting this spell, the magus learns what all of his descendants believe to be the answer to a question chosen by the magus at the time of casting. This spell functions in a manner similar to the spell Posing the Silent Question (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 149). It is not always obvious to the caster which answer came from which descendant. To be certain which descendant a particular answer came from, the caster must typically make a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 3 plus the number of descendants that are affected by the spell (this Ease Factor can be higher if the caster is unfamiliar with some of his or her descendants). The caster does not need to possess Arcane Connections to his descendants for this spell to function. This spell works through the connection of blood. Lambert specifically designed Familial Secrets to not Warp members of his bloodline (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 92).;Magi of Hermes, 66
Funding the blackmailer’s purse;In;Me;"";"30";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"25";+1 Eye;"The caster reveals a deep-seated secret in the mind of the target. The caster must have some idea about the subject of the secret; this spell cannot be used to “fish” the mind for a random secret. Instead, based on a piece of scant information, the spell reveals all the sordid details of a shameful deed, embarrassing moment, or concealed history. For example, Persephone notices that Credo the grog flinches every time the word “chalice” is mentioned. This spell will reveal that in her youth Credo stole the sacramental chalice from her local church, that she dared not fence it after committing the deed, and that it lies buried in the packed earth beneath her sleeping pallet.";Magi of Hermes, 92

Scent of loose purses;In;Me;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Smell;"";"5";+1 Touch +2 Sun, +2 Smell;The target of this spell can detect desire and interest as a scent given off by any mind in the target’s vicinity. The more powerful the emotion of desire felt by a person, the stronger a smell that the target of Scent of Loose Purses will detect from them.Lambert frequently casts this spell on his family and people in his employ to help them learn to read the emotions of people with whom they come in contact. Oftentimes Lambert will have someone who does not have Scent of Loose Purses cast upon her give her impressions of people to someone who does, so that they both learn to perceive cues without the aid of magic.;Magi of Hermes, 66

Thoughts within babble;In;Me;"";"30";Per;Sun;Hearing;"";"5";+2 Sun, +3 Hearing;The magus understands the speech of those he can hear. Fortunata’s version is extended to Sun Duration, so she need not concentrate on the spell while studying from texts read out loud to her.;Legends of Hermes, 65
Thoughts within speech;In;Me;"";"30";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"25";+1 Eye;Yet another spell where its creation resulted in a side effect worth keeping, this spell acts like Peering Into the Mortal Mind, but while the magus is searching through the thoughts of the target, the target unknowingly speaks those thoughts aloud, going so far as to even weave them into an ongoing conversation. For example: “Did you hear about the new sheriff? Why yes, I was in the gardens last night. I hear he is going to raise taxes this year.”;Magi of Hermes, 30
Tread of fellow travelers;In;Me;"";"30";Road;Diam;Group,Faerie;"";"5";+2 Road, +1 Diameter, +2 Group;The caster learns the number, state of consciousness, direction and distance to the nearest group of minds on the road he is on in one direction (apart from any group that the caster is in). The caster continues to sense this information for the duration of the spell. This spell and similar magics are common among members of House Merinita. Road Range provides practitioners of Faerie Magic with a tool that can cast spells at very long ranges fairly easily. Such spells, however, can not be cast on targets that are not sensed because of the law of Arcane Connections (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 80). Tread of Fellow Travelers allows the caster to sense targets and thereby cast other spells of Range Road upon them. (Members of House Merinita have developed similar spells using other Hermetic Forms).;Magi of Hermes, 66
Oath breaker’s confession;In;Me;"";"35";Eye;Bargain/Mom;Ind,Faerie;"";"15";+1 Eye, +3 Momentary & Bargain;Like all spells of Bargain Duration, this spell is cast immediately after the caster strikes a bargain with the target and only takes effect if the target breaks her part of the bargain within one year (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 92). If it should come to pass that the target of Oath Breaker’s Confession breaks her agreement, then the caster instantly becomes aware that the bargain has been broken and also learns exactly why and how the target believes that she broke the agreement.;Magi of Hermes, 67
Opinions of the masses;In;Me;"";"35";Per;Conc;Hearing;"";"15";+1 Concentration, +3 Hearing;When this spell is cast, the magus chooses a specific question. For the duration of the spell, the caster will hear a voice answering this question from each mind that he comes in contact with. The thoughts of minds that have dwelled heavily on the magus’s question are perceived as clear voices, the thoughts of minds that have given the matter little thought are perceived as loud whispers. Minds that have never considered the issue (and minds that are protected by Magic Resistance that the spell failed to penetrate) do not make any sound at all. Lambert has on occasion, by use of this spell, heard the opinions of spirits and invisible creatures to which he would have otherwise have been oblivious.If the caster is surrounded by many people, the noise generated by this spell can interfere with the caster’s ability to hear normal sounds. The Ease Factor of rolls involving listening should be increased if the caster is surrounded by people with strong opinions while this spell is in effect.;Magi of Hermes, 67

This communication is not impeded by distance, and may not be revoked by either party without somehow canceling the spell.This spell was developed by a magos who wanted to hear his True Love’s voice at all times, and is generally used for such purposes.

Absent mind of the scholar;Mu;Me;"";"10";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;This spell changes the target’s memory so that he believes that Wizard’s War was declared on him one month prior to when it actually was.The intent is that this spell is cast via an Intangible Tunnel-style effect while the Wizard’s War is legitimately in progress, and the target (believing that the Wizard’s War occurred during the previous month) stops taking protective measures, and leaves the sanctuary of the Aegis of the Hearth. Obviously, this strategy will fail if the target is convinced by another character that their memory is in error. However, it might be very difficult to convince a magus that their memory is incorrect, and to be effective this strategy only requires the magus to make a single absent-minded mistake, such as briefly leaving the Aegis of the Hearth.;Hermetic Projects, 94
Distraction of the magpie;Mu;Me;"";"10";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;The target’s estimation is altered so that shiny objects become highly desirous to him. For the duration of the spell he is easily distracted by anything that glints, and given the opportunity he will acquire such things and secret them somewhere about his person. He must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to complete a complex task in the presence of a shiny object that he does not yet possess.;Art & Academe, 33
Avoiding the blame;Mu;Me;"";"15";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell allows Alexander to rewrite all of the target’s memories concerning a length of time. Alexander uses this spell to misdirect mundane enemies, but its Duration is so brief that it must be used cautiously. It is suitable for assisting his servants, when in trouble with mundane authorities, to gain their freedom long enough to flee an area. It can also be used to trick rivals into social gaffes,which can harm their political position.;Magi of Hermes, 14

Enchantment of the pedestrian pigeon;Mu;Me;"";"15";Eye;Moon;Ind;"";"2";+1 Eye, +3 Moon, +1 complexity;After telling a person a piece of information, this spell is cast to occlude the memory of that information. A key phrase or word is also set at the time of casting, and subsequently uttering this phrase unlocks the memory. If the message has not been delivered by the time the Duration expires, then the memory of the information is restored to the target. A spell to read the thoughts of the target does not reveal the protected information unless its Penetration exceeds the spell’s level.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 98
Seed of betrayal;Mu;Me;"";"15";Eye;Moon;Ind;"";"3";+1 Eye, +3 Moon;Changes the target’s emotions towards his master(s) to contempt, such that he will readily betray them. Subtract 5 points from the target’s relevant Loyal Personality Trait, for the duration of the spell.;Guardians of the Forest, 73

The generous patron;Mu;Me;"";"15";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This spell changes the common sense (see Art and Academe, page 33) of the target. He cannot estimate the true worth of his belongings and is likely to give more of them for less.;Magi of Hermes, 126
My old and dear friend;Mu;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye, +2 Sun, +1 complexity;The target’s memory is altered so that the caster is “remembered” to have performed a major favor for him in the recent past. The caster gets to choose in what manner she appears in the alteredmemory. The target cannot be convinced of the falsity of this memory until the duration of the spell expires, at which point he realizes the deception.;Magi of Hermes, 92
Remembered messages;Mu;Me;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Bound*;Ritual;"";"";To use this spell successfully requires a little preparation, because each target needs to be prepared with a memory that can be altered with little trouble. For example, at sporting or cultural events, everyone may be asked to repeat the recipe for sea urchin soup, or memorize a string of flags.When this spell is required, the memory of the recipe is replaced with a single useful piece of information, or the flags are replaced with a single useful image. For example, an evacuation plan can be distributed in this way, or a series of mustering points for militias.* Remember to add further magnitudes to increase Boundary size. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +4 Bound);Transforming Mythic Europe, 74
The lucid dreamer;Mu;Me;Intellego;"20";Per;Dream;Dream,Mystery;"";"";"";"The magus lies down to sleep and casts this spell, slipping easily into dreaming sleep — except that his conscious spirit appears in the dream and may move and interact freely. He may wake any time he wishes (and may settle again for normal sleep, if he so desires). The spiritual traveler appears in the dream with his clothes, a dream copy of his talisman (if any), and dream vis equivalent to any vis left on his body. Using this dream vis has no effect on the real- world vis left behind; however, the traveler may use that real-world vis via the Arcane Connection to his body.(Base: 15, +1 Dream duration)";The Mysteries, 104
The unbidden task;Mu;Me;"";"25";Eye;Moon;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +3 Moon;This spell creates a simple prospective memory in the target, which repeats itself so often that the target infers a reason for the memory. Simple memories, like, “I need to leave the back door unlocked tomorrow night” draw out reasonable inferences like, “because his lordship is sneaking out for a night on the town after her ladyship falls asleep.” The magus takes advantage of the action the prospective memory guides, so in the example above the magus could send a servant to rob the house, knowing the door would be unlocked.If there is no possible reasonable inference, the spell fails, so it cannot force most characters to commit suicide or do things that are abominable. Characters cannot be convinced to do things that are dangerous unless the character regularly faces that sort of danger as part of his profession. A shepherd might fight off a wolf, or a town watchman arrest a violent drunk, but neither would reasonably infer that they should perform the task better suited to the other.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 70

Apollo’s fearful gaze;Mu;Me;"";"30";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This horrific spell rewrites the target’s common sense, so that light induces pain signals (Art and Academe, page 33). The brighter the light, the stronger the pain sensed. Note that the pain isn’t caused by any wounds, and will disappear as soon as the spell ends, or when the target is no longer exposed to light.Light Source Penalty Moonlight or Candlelight -1 Torchlight -3 Bonfire -5 Daylight Incapacitated;Magi of Hermes, 30
Blissful messenger;Mu;Me;"";"30";Touch;Until;Ind,Faerie;Ritual;"5";+1 Touch, +4 Until;This spell alters the target’s recollection of an event, changing the memories of what actually occurred into memories of a different event decided upon by the caster. This spell is undone by speaking to a specific individual about the altered memories, and the individual who releases the spell must be included in the altered memories in some significant way. For example, the individual could be discussed, the memories could include a prominently placed picture of the individual, or the individual could be “present” in the altered memories. Often the spell is cast to change the recollections of an event into the recollections of a conversation specifying exactly how the spell is to be broken.A Tytalus maga who had need of sending agents to areas where they might be subject to investigation by Mentem spells convinced Lambert’s mater to allow Lambert to study the Lab Text for this spell as an apprentice. Lambert then used the spell for the benefit of the Tytalus who compensated Lambert’s mater for the service. The vis cost of performing the ritual, and the rarity of people willing to trust a Gifted magus sufficiently to allow their memories to be altered, prevents this from being a frequently used tool.;Magi of Hermes, 65
False prophecy;Mu;Me;"";"30";Arc;Moon;Ind;"";"3";+4 Arcane Connection, +3 Moon;This spell alters the victim’s memories of their dreams, so that they recall a persistent nightmare.

Donning the mask of another;Mu;Me;"";"35";Touch;Year;Ind;Ritual;"10";+1 Touch, +4 Year;This spell creates a persona from the identity of another (henceforth called the donor). The donor must be present during the Ritual spell, but need not be willing or even conscious for the correct operation of the spell, though it must penetrate any Magic Resistance as usual.The caster acquires the full memories and personality of the donor as a deep cover disguise with a Reputation score of 3, but which offers no reduction in the social penalty of the caster’s Gift. This spell can also be used on characters who have established a deep cover disguise of their own, in which case it confers the Reputation at the same score as the donor’s, with the same reduction in The Gift’s effects that he enjoyed. If, in the year that the caster maintains this foreign identity, he is able to apply at least 5 experience points to the Reputation, then the Reputation persists once the spell’s Duration expires.The caster must employ further magic to acquire the physical resemblance of the persona. The caster could even fool close friends and family, if his physical disguise is good enough. This spell inflicts one Warping Point on both the caster and donor when it is cast (from the powerful mystical effect), and the caster suffers an additional Warping Point at the end of the spell’s duration (from the constant mystical effect).;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 97
Lost in the memory;Mu;Me;"";"35";Eye;Moon;Ind;"";"15";+1 Eye, +3 Moon;The mind of the target is filled with memory, dominating all other mental faculties. He will relive scenes from his past and visit places of particular significance while neglecting all but the basic urgesto eat, drink, and rest. During this time he cannot put any mental effort into any task, and can only be temporarily roused from his fugue if he succeeds in an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9 or more.;Art & Academe, 33

Visions of olympus;Mu;Me;"";"35";Touch;Diam;Group;"";"15";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +2 Group;This spell causes a group of intelligent beings in the Mentem province of the Twilight Void to become perceptible to others outside of the Twilight Void. For example, a traveler in the Twilight Void might find his way to the lair of a particular creature with which he wishes to communicate. This effect makes the creature able to see and hear him and several others for the duration, as if they were vestiges in the place where that creature lives.;Realms of Power – Magic, 27
Family gathering;Mu;Me;Intellego;"40";Pers;Con;Bloodline,Faerie;"";"15";+1 Concentration, +3 Bloodline, +1 Intellego requisite) Source: Magi of Hermes, 6;"This spell alters the perceptions of the caster and all of those people who are descended from him or her. The affected people think themselves to be in a large, comfortable, well-lit room sitting around a table sufficiently large to seat every member of the bloodline, rather than at their actual locations. Those affected by the spell perceive their relatives to be with them in this room. The room itself is heavily influenced by the caster’s wizard’s sigil.The members of the bloodline are able to speak to one another as if they were in the same room. If a member of the bloodline is asleep when Family Gathering is cast, the spell will not wake that family member; instead that person will experience the spell as a dream and he will have no easier of a time remembering the meeting than he would have remembering any other dream. The words and actions of a dreaming person are often, but not always, sufficiently odd to alert other participants to his or her state. During the spell’s duration, none of the family are able to receive information from their normal senses. (In terms of the mind as explained in Art and Academe, the forms and images collected by the target’s senses are overwritten in the target’s common sense by the Family Gathering spell). The targets of this spell are still able to move and control their bodies, but their inability to perceive their actual surroundings makes this a dangerous proposition.Prior to inventing this spell, Lambert on occasion spontaneously cast a Range: Personal, Target: Bloodline version of Words of the Unbroken Silence and used Familial Secrets to communicate with his children, but he found such communication to be very taxing. Lambert created Family Gathering to facilitate clear communication. This spell is specifically designed to not Warp members of Lambert’s bloodline.";""
Inmost companion;Mu;Me;Animal;"40";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"25";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;The target’s mind is made physical as a bird. This bird normally stays close to the target’s body, but need not. If the target has Magic Resistance, it protects both his body and mind, as normal. No matter how far it travels, the target’s mind controls his body, as well as the bird’s, as normal. In particular, it can see through both target also dies, as his mind has been killed.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 149
Swords of silver and moonlight;Mu;Me;Terram;"40";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"25";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell makes the metal accouterments of a ghost solid. Many ghosts are able to affect the world with a single, favored object, but this spell allows them to use their entire kit. Weapons that are a composite of wood and metal work normally for the ghost, but only the metal parts may strike a mortal. Hard-pressed Tremere magi sometimes cast this spell upon the ghosts of dead shield grogs. Eye contact must be made with the ghost.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 140
The road to lemnos;Mu;Me;Intellego;"40";Touch;Dream;Dream,Mystery;"";"";"";The magus touches a dreaming sleeper (or the magus, as in The Lucid Dreamer), and the target dream changes to include the spirits of a touched group of travelers (possibly including the caster). The travelers’ bodies lie in a trance while in the dream.The spiritual travelers appear in the dream with their clothes, a dream copy of their talisman (if any) and dream vis equivalent to any vis left on their bodies. The travelers have Arcane Connections to their own bodies, and may use these to leave the dream before the spell ends.(Base: 30, +1 Touch, +1 Dream duration);The Mysteries, 104

Rewriting the mind;Mu;Me;"";"45";Voice;Year;Ind;Ritual;"15";+2 Voice, +4 Year;"This spell utterly changes the target’s capacity for cognitive thought; all previous goals, hopes and desires are set aside in favor of the agenda dictated by the magus at the time of casting this spell.

Spectral quinreme;Mu;Me;Herbam;"50";Eye;Moon;Str;"";"15";+1 Eye, +3 Moon, +3 Structure;A ghostly ship is not the spirit of a ship, it’s a prop projected by the psyche of a ghost, like the clothes or weapons of a ghostly soldier. Ghost ships, as figments of the imagination of the dead, can be called up with Mentem magic. This spell makes a spectral ship sufficiently solid for humans to sail upon her, and stow cargo safely within her hold. It does not summon or command the ghostly ship: that requires the magus to summon and command the ghost or ghosts who manifest the ship.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 140

The spell does not give the crew any Abilities they did not already have, but it makes them think and act as if they are Viking warriors, including acting as a trained group in combat.;""
Arming the legion of the dead;Mu;Me;Terram;"70";Touch;Moo;Group;Ritual;"25";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Group, +3 size;This spell makes the metal accouterments for an army of ghosts, up to 10,000 strong, solid. It does not, however, give caster any control over the ghosts. Many ghostly legionnaires can affect the world with a single weapon, but this spell allows them to use their complete kit, granting missile attacks, the ability to engage in field engineering, and the use of siege weapons.GENERAL;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 140
Lay to rest the haunting spirit;Pe;Me;"";Gen;Voice;Mom;Ind;"";effect);"";If your spell penetrates the resistance of a ghost or similar spirit, it loses a number of points from its Might equal to the level of this spell.

Distraction of the weakened mind;Pe;Me;"";"5";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye;This spell removes a specific memory from the target’s mind. Specifically, the memory is of whatever activity Lucia is engaged in when she casts the spell upon her target. So if she persuades a guard to let her into a locked room she casts this spell upon him and he remembers only that they talked. He does not recall that she entered the off-limits room.;Tales of Power, 116
I was never here;Pe;Me;"";"5";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye;The target forgets meeting the caster. Prior contact between the caster and the target must be limited to a brief and relatively insignificant event occurring within the last day, and includes the casting of this spell. This spell is perfect for making a target forget seeing the maga overtly cast a spell, or causing a sentry to forget letting her through a gate. However, a person cannot be made to forget who stabbed him.;Magi of Hermes, 93
The blinded sentry;Pe;Me;"";"5";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch;Renders the target insensate for a moment, sufficient for the caster to slip past him, raise a shout, cast a spell, or pick his pocket. Only the initial touch is registered by the target.;Guardians of the Forest, 73

Tip of the tongue;Pe;Me;"";"5";Eye;Diam;Ind;"";"";"";Causes the target to forget one word of your choosing. The target cannot remember that word for the spell’s duration, but afterwards he can come up with the word without assistance by making an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 9+. If the target fails he may try again, but each additional roll adds +1 to the difficulty. (Base 3, +1 Eye, +1 Diam);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 150
Agnosia;Pe;Me;"";"10";Eye;Su;Ind;"";"3";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell destroys familiarity with a category of object represented by a single noun. The victim of this spell cannot recognize instances of the thing, although she is that aware such things exist. If confronted with a representative object, the victim cannot identify or use it. This spell does not destroy Abilities, so if the character is placed in a position where she uses an object without conscious monitoring, her Abilities return. This can be alarming for the spell’s target, since she cannot consciously use the tool to repeat her inadvertent actions.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 69
Breaking the captain’s baton;Pe;Me;"";"10";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice;The target ceases to be able to coordinate a squad of soldiers as a Trained Group. The memories required to use that skill are removed and do not return when the spell ends, but can be regained with simple demonstration and practice, requiring time but not experience. The target is aware that he has forgotten how to lead warriors in battle. Unless another member of the group is able to take over as leader, the squad fights as an Untrained Group instead. This is a less efficient version of Dissolving the Wall of Shields (Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 70) since it targets only the current leader rather than the entire squad.;Magi of Hermes, 50
Slap of absent magic;Pe;Me;"";"10";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +1 Diameter;The target forgets how to consciously use one Form for the duration of the spell. This includes casting spontaneous, formulaic, and ritual spells of the Form. It also includes spells that use the Form as a requisite. Unconscious use of the Form (for example, the Form bonus to Magic Resistance) is unaffected.When this spell ends, the target recalls how to use the Form.;Hermetic Projects, 85
Trust of childlike faith;Pe;Me;"";"10";Eye;Diam;Ind;"";"4";+1 Eye, +1 Diam;The target loses judgment and believes almost any passable lie for the duration of the spell. An Intelligence stress roll of 6+ is allowed to resist. Truly incredible lies allow easier resistance rolls.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 150
Calm the motion of the heart;Pe;Me;"";"15";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice;Removes one emotion from the target until it appears again naturally. An angry person stops being angry, and a curious one stops being inquisitive.

Loss of but a moment’s memory;Pe;Me;"";"15";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+1 Eye;Removes up to five continuous minutes from a target’s memory, leaving a blank. You target the loss of memory to a specific event or time. With an Intelligence stress roll of 9+, the target realizes that memories of a certain period are missing. This Ease Factor can change, depending on how important the missing memory is and what sort of circumstances surrounded the event. Careful introspection over a period of time can allow reconstruction of much of memory, but some details are lost forever.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 151
The twice-gifted coin;Pe;Me;"";"15";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch;This spell is usually cast when the target deposits a coin into the caster’s hand. The victim immediately loses his memory of having paid. Assuming that he had a legitimate reason for paying in the first place, he then usually reaches for his purse to hand over another coin.Some sneaky covenants have been known to enchant this effect into a toll-gate, for example. Travelers are asked to pay a toll before the gate, then allowed to proceed, whereupon they touch the gate and promptly forget having paid. Upon request, they then pay again, after the gate. The income from a toll station can thus be doubled.;Covenants, 62
All vows forgotten;Pe;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell diminishes the importance of whatever vow, promise, obligation, or duty should be uppermost in the target’s mind at the time of casting.;Tales of Power, 116
Calm mind of resolute behavior;Pe;Me;"";"20";Per;Diam;Ind;"";"";"";For the duration of this spell, all emotions are banished from the caster’s mind. This makes the caster unable to feel fear, doubt, hope, or any other emotion. Any effort to manipulate the caster based on his emotions will automatically fail. The caster can make no rolls based on his Personality Traits for the duration of the spell. Despite the temporary absence of emotions, the caster’s goals and priorities remain unchanged and the caster retains recollections of emotions that he has previously felt.Lambert’s mater believed that this spell was an essential tool for anyone who dealt with the faeries. She believed that casting Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior, to provide Lambert with a moment’s clear reflection before embarking on an activity that might be influenced by the persuasion of charismatic faeries, would save her apprentice from many unwise decisions. Lambert casts Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior when he has an important choice to make and wants to see how he would approach the problem without the complications of his emotions coloring the issue. Lambert finds casting this spell to be quite unpleasant, though, and he greatly fears the possible consequences of miscasting a Perdo Mentem spell on himself. (Base 15, +1 Diameter);Magi of Hermes, 67
Dissolving the wall of shields;Pe;Me;"";"20";Voice;Mom;Group;"";"4";+2 Voice, +2 Group;This spell removes the memories that allow a group of soldiers to fight as a unit. This spell can be used to destroy other simple skills, too small to be encompassed by an Ability. For example, a magus might cast it on a group of courtiers so that all of them forget the steps of a particular dance. These memories do not return when the spell concludes, but may be regained with simple demonstration and practice, requiring time but not experience points.This spell does not damage autobiographical memory, so it is obvious to the victims that he has lost a skill he previously possessed. The spell does not impair judgment, so the victim may infer that the magus is responsible. A version of this spell with Sight Range (level 25) is less conspicuous.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 70
Loss of a lasting day’s memory;Pe;Me;"";"20";Eye;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Eye;This spell removes a specific event from a target’s memory. The event can be up to a day in length and may involve multiple elements.;Tales of Power, 12
Blessing of childlike bliss;Pe;Me;"";"25";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;Reduces an adult mind to a child’s level. The target solves problems, reasons, and expresses emotions as would a three-year-old. Magi affected cannot cast spells.

Embrace of boethius;Pe;Me;Corpus, Vim;"35";Touch;Mom;Part;Ritual;"15";+ 1 Touch, +1 Part, +2 necessary requisites;This spell damages the target’s mind, heart, and Gift, destroying a part of his understanding of formulaic spell casting and forcing him to rely on casting tools. This highly irregular spell was developed to initiate Hermetic magi of other Houses into House Verditius, and is only used in that rare instance. Because of the bizarre nature of this spell, the target receives 7 Warping Points and must check to avoid temporary Twilight.;Houses of Hermes – Mystery Cults, 119
Heighten the mind;Pe;Me;"";"35";Voice;Moon;Ind;"";"10";+2 Voice, +3 Moon;Removes four points of Personality Traits from the individual, which return one-by-one across the Duration. They are taken from weakest Personality Trait first. When that reaches zero, the next least prominent Trait is affected. Negative Traits are similarly affected, but their scores are increased toward zero.This has the effect of removing the checks and balances afforded by the lesser Personality Traits, leaving the mind influenced by its most prominent Traits only.;Dies Irae, 41

The ever-watchful turb;Pe;Me;"";"35";Touch;Moon;Group;"";"5";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Group;This spell prevents the target group from falling asleep by quelling the inclination to rest when tiredness sets in. The target group accrues fatigue as usual: after being awake for a full day, every eight hours of wakefulness causes the loss of a Fatigue level. Thus, after two days awake, they will be reduced to Unconscious (or earlier if they exert themselves) at which time they sleep for eight hours and then wake again.;Art & Academe, 34

It takes several seconds to speak the sentence, so an unwilling, able-bodied target can stop you. If you speak the whole sentence, the target must make a Stamina stress roll of 15+ or go completely insane. You need not use your hands for this spell, but you must be able to speak.;""
Blindness of involuntary obstinacy;Pe;Me;"";"40";Sight;Conc;Group;"";"10";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +2 Group;The targets of this spell become, for the duration of the spell, completely unable to perceive a particular object or entity chosen by the caster while casting the spell. The senses of the targets still work properly, but the minds of the targets are prevented from concluding that the specified person or object exists. In the terms presented in Art and Academe, this spell removes the ability of the common sense to receive or integrate images of a specified object or entity. Lambert frequently specifies himself as the unperceivable object while using this spell.;Magi of Hermes, 67
Closed mouth of the nightwalker;Pe;Me;"";"40";Per;Sun;Spectacle;"";"";"";Special: Sensory MagicAnyone seeing the caster instantly forgets that he did so, assuming that the spell’s Penetration breaches the target’s Magic Resistance.

Mind cleansed of treachery;Pe;Me;"";"45";Eye;Bargain/Mom;Ind,Faerie;"";"";"";Like all spells of Bargain Duration, this spell is cast immediately after the caster strikes a bargain with the target, and only takes effect if the target breaks his part of the bargain (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 92). If it should come to pass that the target of this spell breaks the agreement within a year of the date when the deal was made, then the target’s memory is destroyed, removing every stored idea that the target possesses and his sense of identity. All General Abilities (including languages) are retained, but knowledge of Academic, Arcane, Martial, and Supernatural Abilities are lost, as are all Arts. The target’s imagination, which stores images, is not affected, so he recognizes the faces of people he knows, places he has been, and songs he has heard, but lacks all knowledge about those things such as names, locations, emotional importance, and so forth.Lambert secured a Lab Text for this spell from the Merinita who developed it, in exchange for a copy of the Lab Text for Oath Breaker’s Confession. Lambert wanted to have a spell that provided a profoundly serious consequence for breaking an agreement, and the creator of Mind Cleansed of Treachery wished to acquire a spell that left its targets in a condition that could still be negotiated with. (Base 25, +1 Eye, +3 Momentary & Bargain);Magi of Hermes, 67
The clean slate;Pe;Me;"";"50";Touch;Year;Ind;"";"25";+1 Touch, +4 Year;This spell wipes the memory of the target clean, removing every stored idea and sense of identity he possesses. All general Abilities (including Languages) are retained, but knowledge of Academic, Arcane, Martial and Supernatural Abilities are lost, as are all Arts. His imagination, which stores images, is not affected, so he recognizes the faces of people he knows, places he has been, and songs he has heard, but lacks all knowledge about those things such as names, locations, emotional importance, and so forth. He cannot relearn those memories for the duration of the spell.;Art & Academe, 34
Poisoning the will;Pe;Me;"";"65";Touch;Moon;Bound;Ritual;"";"";You curse a place, be it a valley, town, city, or covenant. The curse gradually saps the will and vitality from the people there. They become less energetic, and slowly stop caring about the place, what happens there, other people, and finally themselves. Colors seem more drab and the days longer, and there is an all-pervading sense of boredom and lassitude. Strong-willed individuals and those with strong Personality Traits are less affected, but still suffer to an extent. All Personality Trait rolls while in the area suffer a –3 modifier. This spell affects only those who are within the cursed area, including visitors to it. Those who leave the area are overwhelmed by the return of their vigor and sense of purpose.

To affect the protected target’s memories, a spell’s level must exceed twice the (level of this spell – 15), as well as penetrating any Magic Resistance.This spell protects the caster’s memories for a single Moon; longer durations are possible, but continuous protection brings magical Warping.(General, +3 Moon)";The Mysteries, 27

Confusion of the numb will;Re;Me;"";"15";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";Confuses a person, who must make an Intelligence stress roll to take any direct action. A roll of 12+ ends the spell, while a roll of 9+ lets the character take the intended action, but the spell remains in effect. Any lower roll means the character is confused and takes some other type of action. When it is imperative for the victim to take an action, the storyguide should allow an appropriate modifier to the roll. While under this spell, a character always strikes last in combat and gets at least a –1 on all attacking and defending rolls. (Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 151

Call the dream;Re;Me;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch, +2 Sun;The caster touches a sleeping person and determines the theme for that night’s dreaming. The actual content of the dream cannot be determined. For example, if the theme is “death” the target might dream about the death of a loved one, or the lifethreatening circumstances he has been in. If the theme is “dogs” he might dream of a beloved childhood pet or being hunted by the lord’s hounds. Some magi try to interpret the meaning of the dreams called by this spell.;Art & Academe, 34

The more lurid and dramatic the threats, the more cooperative the spirit is. If the spell penetrates the spirit’s Magic Resistance, make a stress roll of Communication + Leadership to see how effective the threats are. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty depending on the potencyof the threat, but note that any roll other than a botch compels at least minimal obedience, while increasing rolls indicate a more cooperative spirit. Note that the caster must be capable of sensing the spirit to use this spell, unless it is reinvented at Range Arcane Connection.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 99
Coerce the spirits of the night;Re;Me;"";"20";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;Makes a ghost obey you as long as you can coerce it with threats, such as a threat to defile its grave or to banish it to Hell. The more lurid and dramatic the threat, the more cooperative the ghost is. If the spell penetrates the ghost’s Magic Resistance, roll Communication + Leadership to see how effective your threats are. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty that depends on the potency of the threat, and any roll other than a botch will compel at least minimal obedience.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 152

Lay your burdens on me;Re;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;"This spell brings the target’s secrets bubbling to the top of his consciousness, playing on his mind and making him more inclined to disclose them.For the purposes of this spell, secrets are those things that gnaw at the target’s conscience in the face of questioning — those things that the target would normally strive to keep hidden because of guilt or shame or fear. Secrets kept for noble reasons are not affected by this spell, which was a conscious design decision made by Yestin. This spell does not make the target susceptible to questioning on other matters, and so cannot be used to assist directed interrogation.At the end of the spell’s duration, the target must make a personality roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If the target succeeds, she maintains control over her secret and keeps it hidden. The troupe should agree which Personality trait the target uses in the roll.For each subsequent day that the spell is cast on the target, the Ease Factor increases by 1. Virtues and Flaws may modify the roll and/ or the Ease Factor, with the Storyguide’s agreement.If the personality check fails, the target falls prey to his conscience and seeks someone to confide in. That person may not necessarily be the caster of the spell, and will most likely be someone the target feels he can trust.The Infernal and the Dominion have a strong impact on this spell, dealing as they do with the moral aspects of human life. If the target spends time in the Dominion, the light of the Lord helps to release the truth and the level of the aura is subtracted from the target’s roll. The aura’s Temper (see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 38) also has an effect with Brave, Wise, Strong, or Just Tempers, increasing the aura’s effect by 1.If the target spends the duration of the spell within an Infernal aura, the corrupting influence of the aura reinforces the target’s resolve to keep the secret. The level of the aura is added to the target’s roll. The Storyguide may impose a further bonus to the roll based on any Tarnish or Corruption of the Infernal aura (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 13).Yestin invented this spell as a means to more easily solve those mysteries that the spirit Taliesin led him into; mysteries often solved by knowing what those involved wished to hide.";Magi of Hermes, 141

Searching the haystack for a needle;Re;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";The target of this spell gets a +3 to all sight-based Perception rolls involving a specific object or quality defined at the time of casting. Examples might include the color red, a particular person, or a unusually shaped shell. Magi often employ this spell to help their servants locate a particular type of vis, as long as they have a sample to show the servant. It does not give the target any extra senses, just more sensitivity to a particular visual characteristic. (Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun);Art & Academe, 34
Sinister road;Re;Me;"";"20";Road;Moon;Ind;"";"3";+2 Road, +3 Moon;"Someone walking on the road whom the caster can sense is imbued with a bad feeling about what lies before him; he usually turns away from the road and walks back. This spell works similarly to The Shrouded Glen.";Magi of Hermes, 126
The resolute mind of the tireless researcher;Re;Me;"";"20";Per;Sun;Ind;"";"10";+2 Sun;This spell is designed for a magus to cast upon himself at the start of a day’s work in the laboratory. Andreas of House Bonisagus, frustrated at his constant lapses of concentration, and finding it difficult to maintain focus on his research, came up with this effect in an effort to make his work days more productive. The target of the spell finds his mind resolutely fixed on the task in hand, and does not waver from it. Opinion is sharply divided on the merits of this spell, with the majority of magi considering it little more than a dangerous self-delusion, which warps the mind of the magus, making him dependent and weak-willed. If this spell is used on a daily basis, a magus should select the Addled laboratory routine (see Covenants).;Covenants, 122
Trust me;Re;Me;"";"20";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;Occasionally a Quaesitor may need to question mundanes directly, typically grogs and companions. This spell can be used to make the process less effort and more productive. The effect simply creates a counter-balancing force on the subject’s mind. The Gift itself is not affected in any way, only the subject’s mind is. The spell is as powerful as Aura of Rightful Authority, but more subtle. The spell only acts to level the subject’s attitude to the caster, not make them obedient or unnaturally well-disposed. Since the affected person retains free will, this effect does not count as scrying. Questioning using Aura of Rightful Authority does count as scrying.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 73
Aura of inconsequence;Re;Me;"";"25";Touch;Sun;Spec;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +3 Spec;"Occasionally a Quaesitor may need to conduct investigations in mundane society. Inspired by the non- Hermetic Veil all Eyes ritual (see Houses of Hermes – True Lineages), this spell can be used to aid avoiding mundane attention. This spell can be cast on either the magus himself or an ally; this individual is the recipient. At any point during the spell’s duration, individuals enter the influence of this spell by looking at the recipient. The spell stops influencing people as soon as they look away. The spell’s target is rated at T: Structure. The Penetration of the spell should be noted when cast, as this applies throughout the duration.This spell simply deflects casual attention away from the recipient. Unless the recipient calls attention to himself or an observer is actively watchful, people will pay him no mind. If a character has some reason to be alert they are allowed a Per + Awareness roll of 12+ to noticed the recipient. The Blatant Gift reduces the Ease Factor to 9+. If the magus takes care to be inconspicuous this Ease Factor may be increased. Quaesitors with effective companions often cast this spell on themselves to avoid compromising mundane investigations with their presence. However, animals still react to the magus as normal.";Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 73
Imprison a ghost in a vessel;Re;Me;"";"25";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This spell forces a ghost into a container of some type.

Burning issue of the day;Re;Me;"";"30";Eye;Sun;Group;"";"5";+1 Eye, +2 Sun, +2 Group;After casting this spell, the caster utters a piece of information (true or false) to the target Group, and must speak in a language that the targets understand.

Dancing mania;Re;Me;"";"30";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;The target of the spell dances in a wild and ecstatic way for as long as the caster concentrates.

Endless laughter;Re;Me;"";"30";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"15";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;The target’s body is shaken by loud, uncontrollable laughter that makes normal breathing or acting nearly impossible. Every round the target must make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6, or lose a Fatigue level. If this spell lasts longer than one hour, the target may suffer from an imbalance of his sanguine humor, causing the symptoms of a disease.;Magi of Hermes, 126
Raise the siege;Re;Me;"";"30";Arc;Sun;Ind;"";"5";+4 Arcane Connection, +1 Sun;Given an Arcane Connection to the besieging commander, this spell suggests a pessimistic view of any siege assessment. The effect is not sudden, but rather, is reinforced through the day as the commander reviews the siege. On an Intelligence + Leadership simple roll against Ease Factor 12 the commander resists thesuggestions made by the spell.;Lords of Men, 116
The mania of others;Re;Me;"";"30";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Moon, +1 special;This spell moves the mania or other mental illness from one individual to another for Moon Duration. The two individuals must have different dominant humors (Sanguine, Choleric, Melancholic, and Phlegmatic) for the effect. The mania returns to the originating individual after this point. This provides the magus with an understanding of how shifts in these humors, as might be induced by the movement of the heavens, affect the mind.;Dies Irae, 41
The penitent’s confession;Re;Me;"";"30";Eye;Conc;Ind;"";"20";+1 Eye, +1 Concentration;"The target will truthfully and willingly relate his involvement in anything the magus questions him about. The subject will do his best to inform the magus as fully as possible; he will not ramble in inane detail, be overly literal or in any other way evasive. He may bring up related matters not asked about specifically if he genuinely believes it might be of interest. This effect qualifies as scrying and causes warping, so very few magi will voluntarily submit to it. Magi may allow this spell to be used on their servants however.";Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 73

The target must roll a stress die, adding his Stamina and adding or subtracting an appropriate Personality Trait to see what the effects are.

The caster is not affected by this magic, and his own sleep is natural. Those affected by the spell do not need to eat or drink while it persists, but when they awaken, they are ravenously hungry. Despite the usual length of a Year Duration spell, this spell’s effects always end at the Spring Equinox. This spell was invented by Odorpes of the Sept of Urgen, who lives separate from the rest of her covenant. She hibernates and puts all her covenfolk to sleep with her, so she need not provision them during the winter.;""
Slave of charity;Re;Me;"";"35";Eye;Sun;Ind;"";"20";+1 Eye, +2 Sun;This spell acts as Enslave the Mortal mind, with one exception. The target remains open to all commands as long as the spell remains active. Any time the target hears a new suggestion, he stops what he’s doing and follows the new command, returning to his previous commands when the most recent task is complete. Needless to say this side effect proved quite awkward when discovered.;Magi of Hermes, 30

Those buried by Church ceremony and those have who gone straight to heaven (that is, saints and crusaders, as opposed to the normal folk who must wait for a time before going on) are not available for summoning.

Summoning the spirit of anger;Re;Me;"";"40";Arc;Conc;Ind;"";"";"";"This spell calls a spirit of wrath to the magus’s current location, if he has an Arcane Connection or knows its full name, andovercomes its Magic Resistance. The name can be a non-magical name, and need not be a magical True Name. A wrathful person serves as an Arcane Connection to any spirit of anger; if he has a Major Personality Flaw such as Wrathful, then the spirit has a Magic Might of 30. A Minor Personality Flaw attracts a spirit of Might 20. Otherwise, the spirit has a Might equal to (5 x Angry Personality Trait). Casting this spell inflicts a Warping Point on the source of the anger, unless it is the caster himself.Similar spells exist for summoning the spirits of other emotions.

The face in the mirror;Re;Me;"";"40";Eye;Moon;Ind;"";effect:;"20, +1 Eye, +3 Moon";This spell forces a ghost to possess a magus, but allows the magus to maintain control. This brings the ghost inside Personal range and allows mental communication. The Tremere magus can follow the ghost’s advice and allow it control of his muscles, to use skills. The ghost is usually purged from the magus’s body if the Parma Magica is raised during the duration of this spell, so Tremere Assessors tend to use it briefly, in cities, for urgent, vital tasks. Possession is treated like level 25 Rego Mentem effect.This spell does not summon a ghost. Its designer assumed that he would have the ghost he wished to use stored in a mirror. Tremere magi are supplied with ghosts by Leadworkers, or call them up. This spell allows the magus to give the ghost complex, unbreakable instructions, but Assessors find it best to convince their ghosts to assist. This is not difficult, because most ghosts are tied to the Earth by a piece of unfinished business that they cannot accomplish. The Tremere can usually bargain for the ghost’s assistance, in exchange for the resolution of its problem.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 140
The shrouded glen;Re;Me;"";"40";Touch;Year;Bound;Ritual;"";"";Enchants the Boundary in which the ritual is cast so that anyone moving through it is subtly diverted, effectively keeping some place within it from being discovered accidentally. Anyone not actively searching for the hidden place never finds it. Those actively searching can find the place by making a Perception stress roll of 12+ (allowed once per day). If the surrounding terrain is more difficult to search than the average forest, the Ease Factor increases. Likewise, the Ease Factor drops if the terrain is more open than a forest, and completely open terrain is unsuitable for this spell. Once a searcher spots the hidden place, the spell does not prevent approach. Those who are present for the ritual are unaffected bythe spell. This spell mimics the properties of many faerie forests.

A new body greatly confuses those who are unprepared for the shock, and even those who are ready take a day to adjust completely. Magi who transport their own minds into younger, healthier bodies usually find that having a strong body entails having powerful passions that interfere with the clear thinking needed to pursue the magical Arts. Both people involved must make a Stamina stress roll of 3+, rolled before the switch is made, to survive the transfer. If only one person fails the roll, that person dies and the spell fails. The other target is unaffected.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 152

This spell grants control of the dead, but if ordered to directly oppose their reason for remaining on Earth, they occasionally break the magus’s control. Roman legionnaires asked to attack Rome, for example, might break control.The Art of Terram;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 141

The magically created sword must penetrate in order to harm opponents who have Magic Resistance. Note that creating artificial things with magic requires an Intelligence + Finesse roll (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 77). An Ease Factor of 6 is sufficient to make a sword of mediocre, but serviceable, workmanship.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 37
A network reminiscent of rome;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch +4 size;Medieval roads vary in design, so in this spell the road is based, roughly, on the dimensions of Roman roads, which are just under three paces wide. For simplicity’s sake, the road is assumed to crown slightly, but average half a pace thick.In Hermetic magic, all permanent creations spells are rituals, and all rituals are, at minimum, level 20. This means that for a simple shape, like a road, it’s no easier to create a permanent road ten paces long than one of the maximum length for this spell, which is 3.78 miles.If the road’s design is complex enough to require an extra magnitude, then either increase the level of the ritual, or shorten the road to0.4 miles. Generally creating a bridge is not sufficiently complex to require an extra magnitude (there is none, for example in Bridge of Wood, Ars Magica page 135) but at the troupe’s discretion, creating a system that has many bridges may require one.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 60
A system of narrow canals;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, + 4 size;In this spell, it is assumed that the canal is stone-lined, 2 paces deep and 5 paces wide. It has straight sides, and has no locks. The wall of the canal is half a pace thick.Due to the Hermetic restriction which makes all rituals level 20 spells, there’s no advantage to a magus who chooses to create canal network of less than maximum length, which is 1.26 miles.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 61
Basalt cage;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +1 Size, +1 complex structure, +2 minimum level of a ritual;This ritual creates a large cage made out of basalt stone with a single gate (also made of basalt) that can be opened and shut. The cage is large enough to hold ten man-sized creatures. Individuals in the cage may find it difficult to escape, if the gate is somehow locked or barred. However, the main purpose of the ritual is to create a cage which is subsequently enchanted as an item with the effect The Entrapped Flame.Note that, if your character is talented at Rego magics, he may find it easier to use a Rego Terram craft effect to sculpt such a cage from a hunk of basalt. However, remember to consider that the magus must make a Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 24 to succeed in casting such a Rego craft effect, as it would be hard for a mundane craftsman to sculpt such an item and it would take him a long time to do so (see Covenants page 49).;Hermetic Projects, 24
Canals that accommodate seagoing vessels;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, + 4 size;The average seagoing vessel in the northern waters of Mythic Europe carries 20 tons of cargo. It has a draft of about 2 paces, although larger and heavily laden vessels may have a draft of just over 3 paces. It is about 6 paces wide, although far larger ships are known. A canal which could accept such a vessel, (14 paces wide to allow vessels to pass each other, 4 paces deep and half a pace thick), created by this spell, can be up to 909 paces long.An added magnitude creates a canal just over 5 miles long, two added magnitudes creates a channel 51 miles long, and so on. This spell can also be used to create stone lined riverbeds.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 62
Creation of the walls of simple cottages;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind,Ritual.;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 size, +1 complexity. For this spell to be created, thin connecting pieces of stone must run between the houses, to allow the Individual target. A Group Target would add 2 magnitudes.;This spell creates a series of identical stone enclosures each suitable, once roofed, shuttered, and portaled, for housing a family. Assuming each cottage is internally 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, and has walls that average 6 feet high and 1 foot thick, each requires 540 cubic feet of stone. That is 20 cubic paces of stone (although that makes no allowance for doorways or windows).Hermetic magic requires that spells of permanent creation be rituals, and that all rituals be 4th magnitude. This spell requires a magnitude for doing complex things, because it creates multiple objects in a precise series. This means that it’s as simple to create one cottage in this manner as to create the maximum possible, which given the amount of stone produced is 5. Every magnitude added to the spell multiplies the number of cottages produced by ten.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 61
Efficient & permanent wall of protecting stone;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, + 4 size;Creates a wall from a single piece of unmortared stone, which gives it far greater durability than conventional walls, unless the caster has a sigil which degrades its composition. Vis is used to prevent the wall disappearing after the spell ends.Due to the quirk of Hermetic magic that makes all Rituals fourth magnitude spells or greater, there’s no advantage to a magus who casts a spell to create a permanent, unornamented, wall of stone smaller than 10,000 cubic paces in volume. That creates a wall 167 paces long, 30 paces high and 2 paces thick.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 55
Permanent wall of protecting stone;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +2 size);Creates a wall 25 paces long, 4 paces high, and 1 pace thick, which is a total of 100 cubic paces of stone. Vis is used to prevent the wall disappearing after the spell ends. Walls made in this way are made of single pieces of unmortared stone, which gives them far greater durability than conventional walls, unless the caster has a sigil that degrades their composition.(As Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 153, modified for permanent creation of walls. The level rises from 10 to 20 because all Rituals have a minimum level of 20 as per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 114 , so magi could increase the Range or Size without cost.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 55

Substance over form;Cr;Te;Muto, Mentem;"20";Touch;Mom;Ind,Mystery;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch;This spell can only be cast in a dream by a physical traveler and the caster must use real-world vis for the ritual. The target object may appear unchanged for now, but it has a reality that extends beyond dream, so that if a physical traveler leaves a dream bearing the object, it travels with him and appears in the real world. If the spell is cast without real-world vis, the object vanishes as it is brought into the real world.;The Mysteries, 108

The shattered goblet;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Group;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +2 Size;At the conclusion of this ritual, the caster throws a glass goblet onto the ground which splits into thousands of sharp glass shards, with many times the volume of the original goblet (about 1,000 cubic paces).If spread about on the ground, the glass shards cause +5 damage to anyone who walks over the ground, but this damage can be totally avoided by wearing hard-soled boots or shoes. The glass can cover an area about 60 paces across in glass 1 foot deep.The glass shards are intended to be used with the Crystal Rain spell. The glass shards can be reduced in size to be more easily carried, using the Miniaturist of Venice spell.;Hermetic Projects, 88
The thirsty dagger;Cr;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"5";+1 Touch, +2 elaborate design;This ritual creates a metal dagger. The blade contains cleverly designed gutters that feed into a reservoir in the hilt. This means that if anyone is injured by the dagger (takes a Wound), then a sample of their blood is collected in the dagger’s hilt. A version of this ritual could be created with as a spell with a duration (such as Sun) for use in emergency circumstances. However, the dagger created with the ritual is not magical, so it does not need to Penetrate Magic Resistance to harm a target (which a spell with a non-Momentary duration would need to do).The dagger can be used as either a thrown or melee weapon. It is less useful in Defense than a normal dagger, and less aerodynamic than a throwing knife. In both cases, this is because The Thirsty Dagger is oddly weighted due to the blood reservoir. The dagger’s weapon characteristics are:Ability: Brawl, Init: +0, Atk: +2, Dfn: –1, Dam: +3, Str: –1, Load:Ability: Thrown, Init: –1, Atk: 0, Dfn: –1, Dam: +2, Str: –1, Load:;Hermetic Projects, 88

The moving parts are on stone pivot points. Each house has stone plumbing for water and sewage. Each cottage requires 110 cubic paces of stone, allowing the construction of 9 cottages.Every additional magnitude multiplies the number of cottages by10.An additional magnitude allows the characters to create a mass of non-identical cottages.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 61

At this level, the spell creates 8 cottages. Every additional magnitude multiplies the number of cottages by 10.An added magnitude allows the magus to create a series of cottages which are non-identical, creating a town less regimented in appearance.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 61

The Animal requisite is required to create the armor’s leather straps, woolen padding, and gambeson — without these elements, the armor would not be effective. The styling of the armor, including any crest that appears on the helmet, depends on your Wizard’s Sigil. The armor is magical, so its wearer cannot punch or grapple a magic-resistant creature while wearing the gauntlets. The armor has the same Load as non-magical armor, and it takes just as long to put on (several minutes at least). An Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 is required to make armor of average quality; a failed roll may result in reduced Protection and/or increased Load, at the storyguide’s discretion.";Houses of Hermes – Societates, 37

The magus’s sigil is incorporated into the design on the obverse and reverse of each coin. An Intelligence + Finesse roll allows the caster to match the design otherwise to that of a specific realm’s coinage; an Ease Factor of 9 means that only an expert would notice the difference. Note that the coins are made of unusually pure silver; even English silver — considered the purest in Mythic Europe — cannot match it in quality. Furthermore, coinage created with this spell is free from nicks, scratches, dents, and tarnish, and unlike a large proportion of coins in Mythic Europe, have not been clipped or divided to make change.";Transforming Mythic Europe, 117

They could not, however, accomplish these feat as easily as a Tremere Architect.This spell makes a wall of granite up to 500 paces wide, 5 paces high, and 1 pace thick. One needs miner’s tools to break through it, though it can be toppled if it is not connected to a support on its side or top. The wall this spell creates has a walkway, protected by crenellations, along one side. Architects who plan to use this spell often master it, because during the Corruption of Tytalus, a Tremere magus had the misfortune to botch this spell. The walkway appeared on the enemy side.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 141

The amount of stone created is vast, something like ten million tons, or a block of stone 215 paces on each side.The type of stone created is particular to the ritual’s design, so variants must be designed for each of granite, limestone, and marble, for instance.;Hermetic Projects, 40
The riches that are rightfully mine(d);Cr;Te;"";"35";Touch;Mom;Group;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 complexity;This spell fills a large chest or other sturdy container with silver pennies equal to about 650 Mythic Pounds. The magus may choose the imprint on the coins, but this mark always bears some trace of the magus’s sigil, which does tend to make them traceable.A copy of this spell resides at the Great Library of Durenmar, but it is infamous for causing inflationary troubles. Given the recent rulings in many Tribunals, a covenant of ten magi would only be permitted to distribute 20 pounds of such silver per year, so that it would take 30 years to exhaust the silver created by even a single casting of the spell. Therefore, while there is nothing to stop a magus from learning this spell in the Great Library, he would surely earn the instant suspicion and attention of the Quaesitores if he did so.;Covenants, 61

Its footprint covers 19,000 square feet, and its towers can be up to 140 feet high. The caster determines the exact design of the church, based on contemporary styles. This church has not been consecrated, and is a church only in the architectural style of the building. Spontaneously appearing churches, particularly those larger than many cathedrals, will certainly raise a population’s suspicions.;Art & Academe, 133
The laboratory of bonisagus;Cr;Te;Vim;"45";Touch;Mom;Group;Ritual;"5";+1 Touch, +2 Group, +5 complexity;This rather well-known spell furnishes an empty chamber of the appropriate dimensions with a fully-equipped, standard Hermetic laboratory. It is generally employed by magi who find themselves with plenty of vis, but who otherwise have difficulties in securing the necessary funds and sources to procure the materials by mundane means. This laboratory is actually rather better than the standard, since the magically created outfittings are perfect. Unless this lab is rigorously maintained at the higher level of Upkeep, however, these Virtues will quickly be lost, and it will degrade to a more mundane standard laboratory. It starts with the following statistics:Virtues and Flaws: Flawless Equipment, Flawless Tools, Spotless Characteristics: Size 0, Refinement 0, General Quality +2, Upkeep +3, Safety 0, Warping 0, Health +1, Aesthetics +1 Specializations: Items 2, Vis Extraction 2, Creo 1.;Covenants, 122
Heights of the great tower;Cr;Te;"";"50";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +7 size, +3 elaborate design;This ritual conjures four fully-formed levels of the Great Tower, each 20 feet in height and building directly onto the level below, adding 80 feet to the tower in an instant. As with conjuring the foundations, this ritual requires an Int + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 12. A failed Finesse roll creates a section of tower of shoddy quality, while a successful roll creates a standard quality section. Botch dice on this Finesse roll are equal to 1 + 1 for each other level where the magus failed to meet the Finesse roll (failures should be recorded for future reference). This represents the inherent complexities and dangers of the project.Botches on this roll should be handled as story events, but clearlya botch in creating and assembling several thousand tons of stone is going to be significant. As the tower grows, the complexity of controlling the magic also grows, as does the risk of disaster, which may act as a limiting factor on the number of levels a magus would feel safe in conjuring.Note that by increasing the level of this spell by one magnitude, 40 levels of the tower could be produced, and 400 levels could be produced by increasing the spell by two magnitudes. But doing so should have a direct impact on the number of botch dice for the required Finesse roll. For each additional magnitude of size, add +3 to both the botch dice and the Finesse roll Ease Factor.Casting this spell creates a preternatural tether of 1 and adds +1 to the aura variation modifier.;Hermetic Projects, 40
Conjuring the great tower;Cr;Te;"";"55";Touch;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"3";+1 Touch, +7 size, +4 elaborate design;This ritual creates the foundations and first two levels of the tower. As the ritual concludes, the walls of a vast tower rise from the ground, surrounding those taking part in the ritual. The walls are vast, but the real power of the spell is shown below ground. The foundations extend deep into the earth, forming cellars, crypts, and cisterns between the immense stone pillars driven into the ground. The time taken to develop this ritual is spent not only in learning how to draw the complex magical forces together, but also in designing the foundations and the lowest levels of the tower, which are filled with rooms, cloisters, courtyards, and arcades.Creo magic that creates artificial things, such as this huge tower, requires an Int + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor, in this case, of 12. If the roll fails, the tower is still successfully conjured but may require additional work to improve its appearance or to repair defects introduced by the casting. A failed Finesse roll creates a section of tower of shoddy quality, while a successful roll creates a standard quality section. If the Finesse roll botches, the foundations are not strong enough to support the tower and a stress check against damage is required each year.The +7 magnitudes for size creates a circular tower of two levels, 2,000 feet in diameter, standing 40 feet above ground level. The high modifier for the elaborate design is required for the precise placement of the foundations, a hugely important factor in a tower this large.Casting this ritual causes a +1 preternatural tether, as per Realms of Power: Magic, page 10. If the site has no supernatural aura, this creates a level one Magic aura.;Hermetic Projects, 39

Over a period of a day, the volcano erupts, darkening the sky with plumes of ash, and forming a large volcanic crater.Obviously, the eruption of the volcano devastates villages, towns, monasteries, covenants, or other settlements built in its shadow. Once the spell has been cast, there is no active magical effect; the eruption is natural and does not need to Penetrate MagicResistance, and consequent rivers of lava and falling ash can also pass unhindered through an Aegis of the Hearth. The caster of the ritual also needs some form of protection to avoid being killed in the eruption.The volcano region can be up to 20 miles in diameter (though the crater will be a fraction of this size), and the peak can be up to 15,000 feet high (which would make it one of the taller mountains in Mythic Europe).Intellego Terram Spells LEVEL 4";""

The caster can confirm this by casting the spell several times: a volcanic rock will always land on the same spot on the map.Note that a volcanic rock created via Creo Terram magic will not reveal what volcano it came from when thrown onto the map with the Trail of Ember spell.

Links of stone;In;Te;"";"25";Arc;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+ 5 Arc;The caster holds a piece of stone in her hands and receives a brief mental image of the surroundings of the object that this stone is an Arcane Connection to. This spell could be used to find the statue that a fragment came from, or the quarry that the blocks of a castle were chiseled from. If the stone is an Arcane Connection to several things, then the newest Arcane Connection, or the closest, is revealed.;Ancient Magic, 36
The wisdom of sleep;In;Te;Vim;"25";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +1 Vim Requisite;The caster sleeps with the target object beneath his pillow, and his dreams then inform him of all mundane properties of that object. The magic is of Momentary Duration, but the sleeping mind is more able to assimilate the huge amount of information that might be called up, weaving it into the caster’s dreams throughout the night. Note that this spell does not allow the caster to actually talk with the object or divine any secrets that the object may store in whatever passes for its intelligence.This spell uses Terram in its all-encompassing form referencing all solid objects, and requires casting requisites appropriate for the target object.The Vim requisite allows the spell to inform the caster of any active or any recent magical effects on the object. This spell is restricted to effects originating from the Magic Realm. Enchantments inherent to the object are not learned beyond a knowledge that some form of enchantment exists.Yestin’s version of this spell sees him conversing with the object within his dreams, wherein the object adopts a persona (or rather, Yestin’s dream ascribes a personality to the object). Multiple castings of this spell on multiple objects are possible, though the caster’s pillow as well as his dreams may become a little crowded. The quirkiness of the spell effect is due to experimentation. Yestin had intended for a more conventional spell, but he found towards the end of his experiments that the spell’s incantation wasn’t complete until the caster fell asleep. His Laboratory Text for this spell carries the same flaw. It’s possible that practitioners and researchers of Dream Magic may be interested in Yestin’s text for this spell, as it may further their own magical aims.;Magi of Hermes, 141
Tracks of the faerie glow;In;Te;"";"25";Per;Conc;Vision;"";"4";+1 Concentration, +4 Vision;"Causes even faintly perceptible tracks of a specific being to glow with a faint magic light, making them stand out when you are within 30 paces of them. The glow provides a bonus to Tracking rolls, which depends on the relationship between the target being tracked and the terrain. If the target is magically related to the terrain, +2; native to the terrain, +4; neutral to the terrain, +6; inimical to the terrain, +8. Tracking at night without a light source doubles the bonus. The more faint the tracks are, the more dimly they glow, so the storyguide may also modify the bonus based on the length of time since the target passed.";Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 153
Commune with the fire soul;In;Te;"";"30";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"20";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration;The caster plunges his hands into lava (which will cause damage if he is not protected) and communes with the spirit of the volcano. If the volcano’s spirit is a creature with Might, then this spell needs to penetrate its Magic Resistance.The length of time a conversation with a volcano spirit takes is highly variable, and depends on the activity of the volcano. The spell allows the caster to perceive and participate in the conversation at either great speed or very slowly, as appropriate. A conversation of a few simple sentences with a dormant volcano could take many days, and would therefore require either a spell with a different duration or magical effects similar to Maintaining the Demanding Spell (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 162) in order to maintain the Concentration duration. On the other hand, a long multi-faceted discourse with an active volcano can be conducted in a fraction of a round.;Hermetic Projects, 25
Listen to the bells;In;Te;"";"30";Touch;Diam;Ind;"";"";"";The caster of spell holds a bell and he can sense whatever the bell can sense with its magical senses. Usually a bell has no magical senses, but this spell is useful if the bell has been enchanted with some, as is the Assassin’s Bell.In the case of the Assassin’s Bell, using the bell’s senses provides enough information to use or target tunnels that the bell can hear. (Base 20, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter);Hermetic Projects, 83
Stone tell of the mind that sits;In;Te;"";"30";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"20";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration;Allows you to talk with natural stone.

You can tell the direction, distance, weight, number, and manner of movement of moving things. For instance, you might sense “a single 50-stone creature slithering toward us, a hundred rods in that direction.”;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 154
Love’s unfaithful witness;In;Te;"";"35";Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"25";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration;This spell is used to question jewelry about its wearer’s activities. The sympathies of the largest gemstone determine the personality of a piece of jewelry. Rubies tend to be bloodthirsty, garnets sanguine and so on, as represented by the Materials Table in Ars Magica (page 110). Unadorned silver is treacherous and unadorned gold is pious, judgmental and accusatory.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 141
Speech of the warding ring;In;Te;"";"35";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"20";+1 Touch, +2 Sun. This spell uses the wall, but a mind is an Individual target.;Stone Tell of the Mind that Sits (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 153), the most popular Hermetic spell for interrogating rocks, does not work on the stone jacket of the island solely because the spell’s target is limited to a square pace cubic in size. Characters using this spell can speak with far larger stones.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 77
Dream of the mind that sits;In;Te;"";"45";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"";"";Allows you to probe the memories of a spirit within a natural stone object. The spell also perfects those memories in the same way as The Good Witness. Probing the memories of such a spirit is extremely slow. A typical session lasts between six and twelve hours, during which the caster is oblivious to the outside world. The spell allows the caster to perceive the memories of the spirit. The spirit’s senses are limited and slow, but its memory of them is very long. Using this spell the caster can relive events witnessed by the spirit, as it recalls them. Larger stone objects have more powerful spirits and so have better perceptions. Precisely what level of detail an individual spirit can perceive is up to the storyguide. (Base 30, +1 Touch, +2 Sun);Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 74

A window of singular direction;Mu;Te;"";"10";Touch;Ring;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Ring;This spell, created by the Architects of Tremere, makes a circle of wall transparent, from one side only. It was developed in the early years of the Order, to allow magi protected by temporary fortifications to target their foes.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 141
Blunting the iron’s bite;Mu;Te;"";"10";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"1";+2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 affect metal;Cast against any bladed weapon, this spell warps and blunts the blade hopelessly. The affected weapon has its total damage (including Attack Advantage) reduced to half (round up). The weapons return to their undamaged state once the Duration expires. While this could be invented as a Perdo Terram spell, Hugh prefers this version since it has the additional effect of making the affected weapons blocked by Magic Resistance. Hugh often casts this spell forcelessly, against the most dangerous-looking of his foes.;Magi of Hermes, 50
The crystal dart;Mu;Te;Rego;"10";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Rego requisite;A 10-inch crystal dart rises from the ground at your feet, floats into the air, and speeds off like an arrow at a target that is within Voice range.

Conjure the ocean’s breath;Mu;Te;"";"15";Touch;Moon;Part;"";"2";+ 3 Moon, + 1 Part, +1 Touch;Developed for the traveling magus who needs a quick, easily tradable resource. Conjure the Ocean’s Breath turns a large patch of dirt into salt. It is best that the magus not be around when the spell’s duration expires.;Magi of Hermes, 31
Hiding the mystic key;Mu;Te;Herbam;"15";Touch;Conc;Part;"";"3";+1 Concentration, +1 Part, +1 stone, +1 for requisite to change wood as well as stone;This spell lets the caster soften a rock, pillar, menhir, tree, or otherstone or wooden object so that he can mold a cavity, hide a small item, and then close it over as if it had never been changed. This enables him to embed an item under, but near the surface of, a natural feature of a grove — favored for disguising the location of a Key to the Mystic Veil item. (The cultist touches the pillar or tree just above the hiding place.);The Mysteries, 116
Rock of viscid clay;Mu;Te;"";"15";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part;Softens rock enough that it may be dug out, molded, and otherwise manipulated in the same way that hard river clay can be. The rock is slightly sticky. The spell affects rock in a roughly spherical shape with a three-foot diameter.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 154
Armatura vitrea;Mu;Te;"";"20";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"2";+2 Voice, +2 Diam, +2 metal;Designed for those who fear the threat of armor-wearing assailants, Armatura Vitrea transforms one attacker’s armor into glass. The armor now provides a protection of 2, and a load of 3. If struck with a weapon, the glass armor shatters sending razor-sharp shards everywhere, adding an additional simple die to the attack’s damage. This, of course, destroys the armor.;Magi of Hermes, 31
Edge of the razor;Mu;Te;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 metal;Sharpens any metal edge to a degree unequaled by manual methods. An edged or pointed weapon gains a +2 bonus to Damage. Good- natured magi reward grogs by enchanting their weapons in this way, although since the resulting sword is resisted by Magic Resistance they rarely do this for all their grogs.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 154
Earth that breaks no more;Mu;Te;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Part;"";"";"";Turns a volume of packed dirt of up to ten cubic paces into stone. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +1 size);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 154
Ink of noblest metals;Mu;Te;Aquam;"20";Voice;Diam;Ind;"";"";"";This spell transforms gold into a liquid that is applied as ink. When the spell expires, it turns back into solid metal, allowing magi to place it on a page without developing skill with gold leaf. By pouring the golden ink into molds, the magi can set it into shapes. (Base 3, +2 metal, +2 Voice, +1 Diameter);Covenants, 97
Object of increased size;Mu;Te;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 stone;This spell enlarges an inanimate object originally no bigger than a large chest. The object doubles in each dimension and increases its weight eight times. The size increase is based on the object’s original, natural size, so casting the spell more than once on an object has no effect. Noble elements like gold, silver, and gems, are not affected by this spell. If any part of the item resists growth, the item as a whole does not grow. Casting requisites are required for the appropriate Form for the target.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 154
The weightless menhir;Mu;Te;"";"20";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +1 stone, +2 day — the base size is big enough without adding magnitudes for size;This spell makes a stone as light as a feather. Muirgen created this spell to easily move the portal stones.;Tales of Mythic Europe, 12
Hardness of adamantine;Mu;Te;"";"25";Touch;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 affect metal;This spell instills a metal object with supernatural strength and hardness. Even weak metals like gold or lead can be affected. The object becomes nearly unbreakable by mundane means.If used on chain mail or metal scale armor, the Protection value of the armor is increased by +2. If used on an edged or pointed weapon, the weapon gains +1 to damage. This bonus can be combined with that from Edge of the Razor or other spells.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 37
Short step of the ghost;Mu;Te;Auram;"25";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"10";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 affect stone;The stone in a section of wall momentarily becomes as permeable as mist, allowing the caster to step through. The wall solidifies behind her. It affects an area as large as a door, but the wall cannot be more than one foot thick. The highly unnatural substance that the section of wall briefly becomes does not affect its structural integrity.;Magi of Hermes, 93
Rapid excavations;Mu;Te;Aquam;"30";Voice;Sun;Part;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Part, +1 large target;This spell allows Alexander to turn large volumes of sand into water, which rapidly dissipates in the desert heat. Alexander uses this spell to excavate sites that have become sand-bound, and to disorient foes by making the ground they are standing on into a deep waterhole. This spell can affect one hundred cubic yards of sand. Alexander can alter the shape of the space affected with a Finesse Roll.;Magi of Hermes, 14
Scattering like light;Mu;Te;Imaginem;"30";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+2 Voice, +2 metal +1 Requisite;This spell changes the metal in an object, a sword for example, into iconic species. Passing light carries off these species, which are absorbed when they strike a non-reflective surface. This spell disintegrates objects, so it has obvious combat advantages, but it was originally created by an artist seeking an efficient method of plating objects in metal. He placed the metal and the object he wanted to plate, levitating, in a supernaturally lit box, mirrored on the inside, and used this spell to turn the metal first into species, then back again. This created a smooth coat of metal around the object, and the interior of the box.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 63
Teeth of the earth mother;Mu;Te;"";"35";Voice;Sun;Group;"";"3";+2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 fancy effect;You cause twenty pointed pillars of white marble to spring up from the ground to a height of 12 feet, forming a circle 3 paces in diameter. At their tops, the pillars are thin and as sharp as spears. At the base, where they touch, they are 18 inches thick. When the pillars spring up, they can be used to cage people, to form a wall, or simply to skewer enemies. Climbing to the top of the pillars requires three Athletics stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 12, and the tops break away when the target reaches them, causing the victim to fall. Skewering a target does +25 damage, possibly more on following rounds if the victim struggles or is exceptionally heavy. When the spell ends, the pillars crumble to dust.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 154
Miniaturist of venice;Mu;Te;"";"40";Touch;Sun;Group;"";"4";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 Size, +1 affect glass, +1 increased shrinking effect;This spell reduces 100 cubic paces of glass into a small volume, about 1 cubic foot. The shrunken glass can be more easily transported.When the spell ends, the glass bursts back into full size. Anybody within 9 paces of the shrunken glass takes +10 damage from flying shards of glass. Bursting back in this manner breaks any complex glass objects.;Hermetic Projects, 89
Transmutation of fire;Mu;Te;Herbam, Ignem;"40";Voice;Sun;Part;"";"5";+ 2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 part, +1 to affect stone, +1 Herbam requisite;This spell transmutes an object of stone, wood, or soil, or part of some such object, into a fire. The fire is still essentially the original object and will not be extinguished for lack of fuel, but it can be doused or extinguished in other ways. The transmuted fire is no larger than 2 paces in size and it is hot enough to do +5 damage. Objects smaller than 2 paces in size will turn into fires of their own size when they are subjected to this spell.;Magi of Hermes, 113
Solidity of stone;Mu;Te;"";"45";Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch, +3 Moon, +4 size, +1 affect stone;This spell changes a mass of stone so that it has the unnatural property that it does not melt, even when heated to tremendous temperatures. The purpose of this spell is to prevent a building created out of molten lava (like that created by Tower of Lava) from dissolving back into the bulk lava.Obviously, this spell must be cast every month otherwise the tower will melt and collapse.The stone will still be hot, even if it is solid. So, a building protected like this will need to be cooled (or inhabited by characters immune to heat).;Hermetic Projects, 19

Undoing the stonemason’s handiwork;Pe;Te;"";"15";Voice;Mom;Part;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Part, +1 destroy stone) Source: Houses of Hermes – Societates, 3;This spell smashes a piece of masonry or pavement into its component bricks or stones. It has no effect on solid stone. The affected volume is one pace wide, one pace high, and up to one pace deep (depending on the thickness of the masonry), and can be a part of a larger piece of stonework.Followers of the School of Vilano sometimes use this spell to produce a large number of loose stones, which they can then use as ammunition. Magi with a knowledge of stonemasonry can use it to weaken or collapse stone structures by damaging load-bearing walls and arches, though solid pillars and the like are immune toits effects.;""
Broken word broken sword;Pe;Te;"";"20";Touch;Bargain/Mom;Ind;"";"2";+1 Touch, +3 Bargain, +2 affect Metal;If the target breaks the bargain made when this spell is cast, then his sword (or other metal weapon) is catastrophically weakened, and when next the weapon strikes (or parries) a blow it shatters. The weapon must be named by the caster, and carried by the target, at the time that the bargain is made.;Through the Aegis, 78
Carve domain;Pe;Te;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +3 Size;Carve Domain destroys a channel of up to 10,000 cubic feet of earth.

Gleam of the freshly-polished glass;Pe;Te;"";"25";Touch;Moon;Room;"";"";"";This spell maintains the equipment and tools of a lab in a constant state of immaculate cleanliness. Dirt, dust, and grime are all removed, leaving the outfittings positively gleaming, as if they had been freshly dusted and polished. This grants the Spotless Virtue to the lab, provided that the spell is cast every lunar month. If the spell ceases, the magus must maintain this pristine condition through more mundane means, otherwise the Virtue is lost. There is just one small drawback to this spell — the lab’s Warping score increases by one point (giving a Personality Trait Spotless +1) due to the unnatural nature of this cleaning, for as long as it is active.

The hidden warren;Pe;Te;"";"40";Touch;Mom;Part;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Part, +4 Size, +1 for Stone, +2 for complexity;This spell carves out 2,500 linear paces of passageway that is two paces by two paces, for a total of 10,000 cubic paces of stone or mixed stone and dirt destroyed. This space may be adjusted to create doorways, rooms, and stairs with a Finesse roll against anEase Factor of 12. An Ease Factor of 15 allows for more intricate details like chairs, tables, and shelves. This spell carves through dirt and stone alike, but a structure cut primarily out of dirt requires wooden supports added afterwards. This spell easily creates a space 6 paces underground, with twenty 5-by-5-by-3 pace rooms joined to a 2-by- 2-by-60 paces corridor, for approximately 1,775 cubic paces, and allows for 5 such levels, each joined by a 2-by-2 pace stairwell 6 paces deep. The form of the excavation can be modified by the caster, however.;Dies Irae, 69
The fate of carthage;Pe;Te;"";"45";Arc;Mom;Bound;Ritual;"5";+4 Arcane Connection, +4 Boundary, Ritual;Over the course of a season, any crops or livestock farmed on the affected land suffer as though being starved. Deprivation checks at three-day intervals may be unwieldy for use across the season, so it is reasonable to assume that harvests fail and livestock dies unless food is brought in from outside the affected area. As a rule of thumb, assume that the income from the affected land halves each season, with the effect being noticed after the first week. The effect is permanent and the soil cannot support life until healed in some way.The base level of 5 is used as the spell is destroying only a single aspect of the soil, namely the ability to nourish crops and animals. The high vis cost of this ritual is compensated by the ability to strike unseen from afar.GENERAL;Tales of Power, 126

The magus must succeed with a Perception + Finesse roll substituting for Craft: Glassworker against an Ease Factor at least 3 higher than the mundane Ease Factor. Failure reduces the glass to a slumped lump as if an incompetent beginner had worked on it.Note that in the thirteenth century, most glass is not particularly clear — making clear glass is an alchemical process, beyond a craft- spell.

Roughly speaking, it has the capabilities of a very strong person (Str +5). The heavier the object is, the slower the unseen porter moves. If delicacy is required, high Finesse stress rolls (12+ or so) are needed. The spell can only carry inanimate objects, and cannot carry you.

The earth returns to its prior position after the target of the spell has passed. The spell ends when the caster comes to a stop, such as to rest, or crosses terrain unaffected by this spell, such as a wooden bridge or a ford.This spell has little effect on soft or muddy paths, as the earth must still be able to bear the target’s weight. The spell is potent enoughto move stones and cobbles in the road.A traveler using this spell does not suffer undue delay for traveling over poor roads. Traveling at speed to cover more ground in the day still costs the stated Long-Term Fatigue level. City & Guild, page 85, provides more detail on travel speeds. Targets affected by this spell use speeds close to the top end of the applicable travel speeds.;Magi of Hermes, 141

Ominous evitation of the weighty stone;Re;Te;"";"15";Voice;Conc;Ind;"";"3";+2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 affect stone;Move a stone through the air as fast as a bird flies. When the caster stops concentrating, the stone immediately falls to the ground.The spell’s name suggests one of its common applications: dropping a heavy rock onto someone. Because the stone falls naturally, such an attack is not subject to Magic Resistance. Instead, an aiming roll is required to hit the intended target (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 86). Attacking with this spell normally takes two rounds: one to move the stone over the target, and another to aim and release it.Damage inflicted depends mainly on the size of the stone: +5 for a stone the size of a man’s fist, +10 for a typical building- stone, up to +21 for a large boulder (see also the Impact Table on page 181 of Ars Magica Fifth Edition). Particularly large stones can damage structures as well as creatures.The main limitation on this spell’s combat effectiveness is the availability of large stones.

Retrieve the bloodied arrow;Re;Te;"";"15";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice, +1 transport 50 paces;This spell causes a small object to be transported from any point within 50 paces (and within Voice Range) to the magus’ hand. Casting requisites may be needed if the object is not mostly part of the Terram Form. The spell’s name derives from its use by the School of Raghallach to retrieve a missile or thrown weapon that has wounded an opponent, even if it is still piercing the victim. By retrieving the weapon the magus has a sample of the opponent’s blood, which is an Arcane Connection that lasts years (+3 bonus to Penetration Multiplier).

If the target object is protected by Magic Resistance (such as an item worn by a magus), then the spell must have sufficient Penetration.The base level for this effect is that for a very unnatural motion. However, for instant transportation the Rego Corpus guidelines are consulted, which adds one magnitude for instant transportation over 5 paces, two magnitudes over 50 paces, and so forth.";Magi of Hermes, 93

Both the exterior and the rooms within become regular: rightangled and with straight sides, or perfectly circular. Irregularities in workmanship are easily perfected, but the building is not redesigned.Normal medieval building design often prevents this spell from working: most medieval buildings have irregular extensions and out-buildings requiring redesign to count as regular — although demolition of the extensions is an easy corrective option. If the whole structure cannot be perfected, the magus can usually perfect individual rooms using Perfection of the Well-Designed Chamber.A building so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry.

A season’s inning;Re;Te;Aquam;"25";Touch;Mom;Bound;Ritual;"2";+1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +1 Size, +1 Aquam requisite) Source: Hermetic Projects, 5;Some waterways, especially those near estuaries, are surrounded by marshland. However, there are techniques for building up and draining the land. This can take many seasons of work, with a large team of laborers working in very difficult conditions. The draining of marshland through the digging of drainage channels and the building of dykes is known as inning. This ritual allows the magus to drain an area 300 by 300 paces to the point that it is dry and stable, as though a season had been spent inning the land. The Aquam requisite is used to move the standing water outside the spell boundary, which makes the inning work easier than normal. This spell uses the rules for Rego Craft Magic (Covenants, page 49) and as such the magus must make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the success and quality of his work. In this case, the Ease Factor is 15 (base 9 + 6 for a season’s work). Failure means that, while the drainage ditches may have been dug, they are either too shallow or too few to drain the land. If left, the land is likely to remain waterlogged and building on it is impossible.;""

The earth rises at a rate of about one inch per day (up to three feet over the spell duration).This is fast enough for people to observe if they watch the earth for more than a Diameter, and the movement can destroy buildings and other structures — even the strongest castle walls run the risk of collapse.This spell only works when cast within a league of a volcano (three miles).

The magus must be touching the ground that he wants the new channel to pass through.The movement of a large amount of earth, while time-consuming, requires little skill. A Perception + Finesse roll against Ease Factor 12 is needed. Failure means that the channel is incomplete, or the old route is still flooded.

Each chair is always at least passably comfortable, but notably more so when cast in a meadow with lush grass. Each chair sinks slowly back into the ground, leaving no trace, as the spell nears the end of its duration. The spell only works on sand or soil, a limitation Yestin aims to fix some time in the future.Yestin decided that, to better capture an audience and draw them into the music, there was nothing like a little peripheral magic to increase anticipation.

Characters inside the building when it is being moved must make Dexterity rolls against an Ease Factor of 6, each round, or lose their footing. Unless special precautions are taken, laboratories inside the building are disrupted by the movement, which ruins any laboratory activities being conducted that season.

Circular wall of shields;Re;Te;"";"30";Touch;Sun;Group;"";"3";+1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 affect metal;"Up to twenty shields rise into the air and form a circle around the caster or anyone he designates. Up to ten people can stand within the circle, if they crowd together, but two shields are needed to give adequate defense to each person. The shields slowly rotate around the circle, providing total cover against missile weapons, and limited cover against melee attacks. The shields provide a Defense Total against melee attacks equal to the caster’s Perception + Finesse plus the Defense modifier of the shield in question. If a shield successfully defends against an attack, the base weapon damage is still inflicted directly on the shield. Each shield has a Soak of 3, and if it takes more than 10 points of damage in a single blow, the shield is destroyed and drops to the ground. Destroying shields leaves some individuals in the ring unprotected; but because the shields move, the undefended individuals change each round. If a person is protected by just one shield, then apply the Defense Total to missile attacks as well as melee attacks. From inside the ring, the shields can be plucked from the air; but once this is done, they cannot be replaced.";Magi of Hermes, 50

From a distance, as the light refracts through the plunging glass, it looks like a curious sort of localized rain. The area covered by the falling glass is about 10 paces across, and anyone in (or passing through) the area takes +10 damage. If a wound is caused, blood from the victim falls onto the earth.This is an Aimed spell that consequently bypasses Magic Resistance, and there is a +12 bonus to the Aiming roll to hit due to the number of glass shards (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 86). This Aiming bonus is for a cloud of shards that contains 100 cubic paces of glass. If the cloud of shards contains only 10 cubic paces of glass, the Aiming bonus is reduced to only +6. Remember to count Defense bonuses because of shields.This spell requires that the caster has large collection of sharp glass shards, which need to be mundane in order to bypass Magic Resistance in this way. The shards could be created using a momentary Creo Terram ritual (such as The Shattered Goblet), or they could be acquired from a mundane craftsman, although this is probably more expensive and inconvenient for most magi. As long as the fallen glass shards remain within Sight range of the caster, the same shards can be used to cast the effect again in a subsequent round.;Hermetic Projects, 89

Steering a vast stone dish;Re;Te;"";"40";Touch;Ring;Circle;"";"2";+1 Touch, +2 Ring, +1 Circle, +6 Size;This spell allows the player characters to direct the voyage of a small floating island whose wall has been created with a level 30 spell. The island travels at the speed of a running horse, which is about 50 land miles per hour. An island with a wall created using a level 35 spell requires a level 45 spell to steer, and one created by a level 40 spell requires one of level 50. Larger islands, if steered by a single spell, can only be maneuvered with rituals.This spell does demonstrate the difficulty of steering with simple spells, however: a Ring 800 paces across requires over 250 concentration rolls to draw. Wise player characters would, instead, invest this spell in an invested device that maintained Concentration for them.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 91

The volcanic crater can be up to two miles across, and the spell has no effect if cast in a location other than a volcanic crater. Obviously, the caster will be caught in the eruption, which may be a problem if he is not protected by appropriate wards.Once the spell has been cast there is no active magical effect; the eruption is natural and does not need to Penetrate Magic Resistance. The effect is considered “slightly unnatural,” as it is natural for a volcano to erupt, but the spell artificially triggered the eruption.

She can also create defensive circles, up to a mile and three quarters across, with each casting of the spell. The channel is not stable, and begins to collapse over the next few days, but if has been used to divert a river, the scouring action of the water may keep it clear.;Against the Dark, 31

The ambulatory laboratory;Re;Te;"";"50";Touch;Mom;Room;"";"25";+1 Touch, +2 Room, +2 complexity;"This spell precisely transports all the movable contents of a chamber into another room to which the caster has an Arcane Connection, leaving their configuration and relative positions intact. Some casting requisites are usually required, depending on the composition of the lab’s outfittings; a Herbam requisite is required to move wooden furniture, an Aquam requisite is required to move liquids, and so on. The destination room must be at least as large as the occupied part of the current room, although it can be a different shape. Magi quite often utilize this effect in order to avoid the tiresome (and expensive) practicalities of moving their sanctum by more mundane means. When this spell is cast on a lab, make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the precision with which the contents are rearranged in the new chamber. The base Ease Factor is 9 + (3 x Refinement). Add three if the lab is Highly Organized; subtract three if it is Disorganized. Also add three if the shapes of the old and new chambers do not match, or six if they are radically different. If this roll fails, the Disorganized Flaw is gained, or the Highly Organized Virtue is lost. If the roll botches, the Hidden Defect Flaw is gained instead.A version of this spell with Arcane Connection Range is also believed to exist; with this more powerful variant a magus may summon the contents of a remote lab into the chamber he occupies. It is not unheard of for a nefarious magus to steal an entire lab in this fashion!";Covenants, 122

The ritual must be cast twice, simultaneously at two different locations, and after the rituals are performed, there is a magical connection between them. The magi conducting each ritual must have an Arcane Connection (such as a clod of dirt) to the other location when they are conducting the ritual. The portal is activated by some command word or ritual determined when the portal is enchanted. Inanimate things and unwilling creatures may be transmitted if someone else says the command word, and pushes the subject through.(Mercurian Ritual)The Art of VimGENERAL;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 156
Faerie chains of the familiar slave;Cr;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Until;Ind;Ritual;effect;+1 Touch, +4 Until;Requisites: see belowThis ritual binds a supernatural creature to the caster as her familiar, until a condition incorporated into the spell comes to pass. The level of the ritual must be no less than (the creature’s Might + 15), though she may also need to penetrate its Magic Resistance if casting on an unwilling target. It has no effect if the target is already bound as a familiar to another.Casting requisites of a Technique and Form appropriate to the creature’s nature and physical form may be included. These two Arts are used to determine the Lab Total for any subsequent improvements to the bond. The cords connecting maga and familiar have initial values of 0, and the vis cost of this ritual does not apply towards these improvements. The maga can strengthen the bond in the lab, but the effect is still inherently temporary. If she casts this on a faerie, she gains the three special powers (Shared Powers, Shared Senses, and Shared Fatigue) associated with a faerie familiar, but the cords will decay as normal, though the bond is never completely broken so long as the spell’s duration remains in effect.Because the bond is often made under duress, the familiar is much more wild and independent than normal familiars, and typically must be subdued or guarded to ensure it does not try to escape. The two are probably at odds most of the time, and the faerie is likely to bear a grudge against the maga afterward if it is taken advantage of or treated badly.;Houses of Hermes – Mystery Cults, 90

The modifier must be 0 or greater, thus the minimum possible spell level is 25. The yearly aura modifier (including the +1 bonus from the casting of this spell) does not add to the roll. If the casting of this spell is botched, a suitable outcome might be either to roll as above, but on the Aura Weakening Table instead, or to make the roll an automatic botch, resulting in the regio outcome.;Realms of Power – Magic, 14

This spell temporarily restores spell traces to a fresh state (as if they had just expired). The spell will restore spell traces of negative magnitude up to the magnitude of this spell –3. The trace must still be existent to be affected (magnitude –9 or greater). Thus the maximum effective level of this spell is 50. Versions of this spell also exist for all standard Targets. Diameter duration is normally long enough to conduct Intellego Vim investigations of the spell traces.(Base, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter);Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 74

Marcus invented this spell primarily to use on caged animals, to see if he could induce monstrous characteristics by infusing their bodies with pure magical energies, but the results were disappointingly random. He had to invent this spell three times before it yielded a breakthrough. The two prior versions both had Side Effects due to experimentation: the first spell changed the color of the target’s hair, while the other made the target’s skin transparent.;Magi of Hermes, 84

Plucking the hair from the billy goat’s chin;Cr;Vi;"";"20";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";"4";+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This spell creates a temporary Arcane Connection to a specific demon within range of the caster’s voice, allowing him to penetrate its Magic Resistance more easily with additional spells. This connection is intangible, a sort of conduit rather than a physical object, and so it cannot be fixed in the laboratory and doesnot itself convey any Penetration bonus. Thus, forcing a demon to teach the magus its True Name is even better.;Realms of Power – The Infernal, 121

Endurance of the witch moon;Cr;Vi;Muto;"35";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"20";+2 Voice, +1 special) Source: Dies Irae, 4;Similar to the common spell The Enigma’s Gift (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 157), this spell causes the target to gain four Warping Points. However, in the case of characters with a specific response to Warping, the effect of these points is to force the target to undergo the Witch Moon just as if the affected target were a member of the Folk Witch hedge tradition, as described in Hedge Magic: Revised Edition, page 42. Enduring the Witch Moon is automatic. This replaces the normal effects of gaining two or more Warping Points, which for Hermetic magi is a roll for Twilight. This effect is inspired by observing the Witch Moon endured by a subject Folk Witch.If you are not using the Hedge Magic: Revised Edition rules, then the following should suffice:The target immediately develops a fever, treated as a Medium Wound. For the period of a month, the target is unable to draw upon their Gift either to use Supernatural Abilities or to cast spells.This potentially disrupts laboratory work, although the use of enchanted devices is unaffected. At the end of the month, make a roll to see if the Witch Moon has passed:To End Witch Moon:Stamina – Warping Score + stress die vs Ease Factor 6If this roll fails, then the target gains another Warping Point and the Witch Moon lasts for another month, inflicting another Medium Wound on the due to fever. Roll again at the end of the second month and so forth, until the target recovers. If the roll to end the Witch Moon is botched, the target gains an additional number of Warping Points equal to the number of 0s of the botch die. Note that the penalties due to wounds do not affect this roll.;""

Consecration of mercury’s house;Cr;Vi;"";"55";Touch;Mom;Str;Ritual;Effect;non-Hermetic;This momentary ritual opens a temple shell to habitation by Mercury. This creates a level 1 Magic aura within the temple precinct (which may be then swamped by a larger aura of a different sort). As this is a momentary Creo ritual, once the ritual has been cast the aura remains and cannot be dispelled. If the temple already has a Magic aura the existing aura is not increased by the casting of this spell. Another effect of this spell is that the temple has the magical property that it is consecrated to Mercury, which is important for some of the other recovered Mercurian rituals. The consecration can be detected by Hermetic Intellego Vim magic (as an effect of eleventh magnitude) and this effect can also be dispelled with Hermetic Perdo Vim (even though the aura itself cannot be dispelled). If the consecration is dispelled the ritual can be cast again to restore this property.The final effect of this spell is that any characters with Faith Points whom are within the Structure at the time of casting (including the caster) lose 1 Faith Point. This Faith Point may be regained in the usual ways.The temple shell must be built to the same plan as the ruined temple (just the temple itself, in the center of the town). The temple can be a different size to this exemplar temple, however. The ruined temple is not currently consecrated.;Mythic Locations, 99

The parish is paralyzed by the social breakdown, and by the end of the spell several parishioners may have been murdered. The parish immediately gains a reputation for being cursed, and it can take years for harmony to be restored. Also, as the parish animals have fled and the fields have been only erratically tended, it is likely that the parish will suffer from famine and starvation in the following year.trAnsformAtIon of flesh to spIrItCrVi(Co) 60R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Str, RitualReq: CorpusAt the climax of this ritual, which must be cast within a consecrated temple of Mercury, the caster kills herself and if she is powerful enough the aura permanently increases by 1 (to a maximum of 10). To determine whether the aura increases two criteria must be met: the caster must have no Art Score with a value less than twice the current aura level, and the Penetration of the ritual must exceed five times thecurrent aura value.If this ritual is cast using Wizard’s Communion then only the leader of the ritual must kill herself, and only the values of her Art Scores are significant.If a character learns of this ritual it may occur to her (Intelligence + Order of Hermes Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 3) that the reputed sacrifice of Trianoma to increase the aura of Durenmar may have been a version of this ritual (see Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, page 8).the nerIusIAn portAlCrVi 65R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Circle, RitualThis holy rite creates a minor level 1 single-layer terrestrial regio around the holy character who performs it, effectively hiding him from the mundane world. It “lifts” the area inscribed by a circle out of the mundane realm for the duration of the spell. The area within the circle can only be accessed using the rules for regiones (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, p. 189-190), although the character who uses this power may enter or leave at will. In the mundane realm, only the inscribed circle is visible, but it otherwise appears empty. This spell uses Purity and Intervention for ceremonial casting. Legends tell of the effect being used during the Diocletian persecutions in the third century to hide Christians from Roman soldiers, and it is said that Nerius developed a greater variation on this spell that allowed him to travel through his regio into the Empyreal realm and return to earth in a different place.;Realms of Power – The Divine, 94

After casting the spell, you may sense how heavy the unknown vis is in relation to the known, determining the number of pawns present.

This could be through a personal evil or sin, or an Infernal ritual. Any event that induces a corruption roll (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 11) taints the location and is equivalent to a tether.

A song of all these faerie places;In;Vi;Creo, Imaginem;"25";Touch;Conc;Group;"";"3";+1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Group, +1 Creo requisite, +1 Imaginem requisite;When the caster stands at a place where the boundary between levels of a faerie regio can be crossed easily, he is able to sing a song or play music that describes the scene on the other side of the regio boundary.As the song sings of each feature on the other side of the boundary, they become clearer in the visual illusion. They then fade slightly as the song moves onto the next feature. For example, where the first line of the song describes the lush grass, in the higher level the grass becomes visible through the boundary, bright and clear. As the next line describes the dry stone wall surrounding the meadow, the wall appears in the illusion but the grass becomes more misty and distant.Those able to see the illusion are also able to pass through from one regio level to the next, as they can see the necessary method. If crossing the regio boundary requires other conditions (help from a resident or a particular date, for example), the spell does not work. As the caster must be standing exactly at the point where the regio layers meet and form a boundary, this spell can rarely be used to actually discern the location of that boundary.;Magi of Hermes, 142

It does not work on tunnels that are cast on other characters. As with Eyes for the Lurking Assassin, a general detection spell might be useful too, but would perhaps make it more difficult to rapidly identify the tunnel in an emergency situation.;Hermetic Projects, 83

In the case of Hermetic effects, this spell gives the Technique and Form, the rough details of the effect and the casting sigil of wizard responsible. It can also detect if a Hermetic effect was generated by a spell or invested device. If the effect was non-Hermetic, similar information is provided, but a Quaesitor without knowledge of that sort of magic may not be able to interpret it.This spell is commonly mastered and combined with Quaesitorial training gives a good chance to detect magical deceptions.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 75

With time and patience, all active spells and fresh traces can be located. Once located other magics can be used to refresh and investigate them.Increasing the magnitude of this basic design allows negative magnitude traces to be seen. The highest nonritual version (Level 50) allows traces of –5 magnitude to be discovered. However, to detect a –9 magnitude trace requires a Level 70 ritual.;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 75

The caster receives no information about the type of creature except that which can be deduced from its appearance. This spell must penetrate the Magic Resistance of the creature; if it fails to penetrate a spirit’s Might, then the spirit cannot be seen by the caster.";Houses of Hermes – Societates, 99
See the light of magic;In;Vi;"";"30";Per;Diam;Vision;"";"5";+1 Diameter, +4 Vision;The caster can detect all active magical effects. Spells appear as glowing lights with a brightness proportional to their magnitude. This spell provides sufficient information to target the sensed magical effects, but the magus does not receive any information about the magical effects, and therefore he does not know which effect is which, if he is looking for a particular one. However, if the caster has used this spell previously, he can identify the presence of a new effect. If there is a large number of effects present, the troupe may rule that a Perception + Awareness roll is required to notice this detail — the Ease Factor should be modified by the total number of effects the caster can perceive and the magnitude of the new effect (relative to the other effects).There may be a large number of magical effects active within the vicinity of the magus — Parma Magica, longevity rituals, Aegis of the Hearth, familiar bonds, enchanted items, and of course, any active spells will all be detected. Active, non-Hermetic, but magical, effects are also detected.;Hermetic Projects, 83

Sight of the active magics;In;Vi;"";"40";Per;Conc;Vision;"";"5";+1 Concentration, +4 Vision, +2 Techniques and Forms) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 15;You can see spells as “auras” around things and people. The color of the aura indicates the Form of the spell working on a subject, the color matching the appropriate one described in Sense the Nature of Vis. The Technique of a spell working on the subject is recognized by the aura’s shape, not color. Creo and Rego are both very orderly auras. Muto is constantly shifting, and Intellego usually is as well, but more slowly. A Perdo aura is usually in fragments. Thus, a magus with both Endurance of the Berserkers and The Invisible Eye Revealed upon him has a very controlled, orderly aura of deep red around his or her entire body, and the magus’s eyes are surrounded with slowly shifting auras of a silvery hue. You should be warned: Imaginem or Vim spells may be used to disguise auras. Also note that this spell will detect the residues of some spells.;""

Eyes for the lurking assassin;In;Vi;"";"45";Per;Diam;Vision;"";"5";+1 Diameter, +4 Vision, +3 detailed information;This spell detects the presence of an Intangible Tunnel-style tunnel, and reveals its sigil. This is sufficient information to use the tunnel or target the tunnel itself with spells.Note that a general Intellego Vim spell to detect magic might be used to provide similar information. This spell, however, specifically detects only Intangible Tunnel effects. This is useful because, as a magus is likely to be often among a lot of magical effects, he does not want to take time to scan his surroundings individually identifying specific effects as he searches for an Intangible Tunnel (see See the Light of Magic). This is important because, if the magus suspects he is under attack by an Intangible Tunnel, he may only have moments to react.;Hermetic Projects, 83
Sight of the sigil;In;Vi;"";"50";Per;Conc;Vision;"";"10";+1 Concentration, +4 Vision, +3 Details;Used by the most experienced Quaesitors, this spell allows the magus to spot active magic or traces of positive magnitude. In the case of Hermetic effects, this spell gives the Technique and Form, the rough details of the effect and the casting sigil of wizard responsible. It can also detect if a Hermetic effect was generated by a spell or invested device. If the effect was non-Hermetic, similar information is provided, but a Quaesitor without knowledge of that sort of magic may not be able to interpret it.GENERAL;Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 75
Day of communion;Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Sun;Group.;"";effect;with two magnitudes devoted to the Duration.) Source: Through the Aegis, 13;This spell is a Wizard’s Communion as found in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 160, but with a longer duration. In accordance with the errata for Muto Vim such spells need a duration at least as long as the casting of the target spell. As Rituals as minimum are level 20 and take 15 minutes per magnitude to cast, a Muto Vim spell needs to last one hour or more, making Duration: Concentration impractical. All the magi in the group must add together the (level-2 magnitudes) of the Day of Communion they are casting. This number must exceed twice the level of the specified ritual being cast. As no more than one magus may join the group for each magnitude of the ritual being cast, this means that this spell is largely useless below level 20. It is highly useful for casting an efficient Aegis of the Hearth, which is no exception to the rule that all spells directly affecting targets must Penetrate.;""
Facilitate the stifled (form) spell;Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+1 Touch;This spell is cast at the same time as another formulaic spell (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 159) whose level must be less than twice the level of this spell. If successfully cast, the targeted spell may be cast with no penalty to the casting total due to reduced or absent gestures and/or voice. While this Muto Vim spell requires gestures and voice as normal, the casting total of the follow-up spell is not penalized, and thus difficult spells at the limit of a magus’s ability have a greater chance of success when in restricted circumstances, without incurring fatigue loss. If the targeted spell has Range Voice, the volume used to cast this spell determines the actual range. There are ten versions of this spell, each affecting spells of one of the Hermetic Forms. This spell is particularly useful to Bjornaer magi who wish to maintain the appearance of mundane animals yet still cast spells.;Houses of Hermes – Mystery Cults, 36

The targeted spell, which would normally use vis of any other type, may instead use vis of the specified Form. There are ten versions of Harnessing The Essential Power, one for each Hermetic Form.

Mirror of opposition (form);Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice;Cast on another spell while the other spell is being cast, this causes the targeted spell to have the exact opposite of its normal effects. This effect works on spells up to half the (level–5) of the Mirror of Opposition spell. The effects of the inversion are up to the storyguide to determine, but the target of the inverted spell usually remains the same as that of the original spell. The inverted spell cannot overcome any limitations of Hermetic magic. For example, if a Momentary Perdo Corpus spell is cast, the inversion is probably a Creo Corpus spell of Sun duration. There are ten versions of this spell, each affecting spells of one of the Hermetic forms.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 159
Passing the reins of corpus;Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+1 Touch;Cast at the same time as another spell, this spell lets the caster pass control of the first spell to another person. The level of the affected spell must be less than the level +1 magnitude of Passing the Reins of (Form), and it only works on spells with Duration longer than Momentary. The spell does not change the target of the affected spell. As with other Muto Vim spells, the caster must succeed at an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 159).;Hermetic Projects, 97

In addition, while the synthemataspell is in effect, the being is aware of the spell and its threat, andusually very much inclined to negotiate if the caster allows it to.

The sorcerer’s fork;Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+1 Touch;This spell splits another spell (whose level must not exceed the level of this spell) into two or more identical spells of reduced power, which may be cast against two or more separate targets. Each resulting spell has the same Range and Target (target category, that is, the actual target may be different) as the original spell, but the power of the effect is divided by the number of resulting split spells. If Sorcerer's Fork expires before the main spell does, the full effect of the spell moves to one of the targets, chosen at random. The precise effect is at storyguide discretion. One casting die is rolled, and the Penetration total is split between the spells. The Sorcerer’s Fork must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell that is to be split. The split spell has a targeting penalty as for multiple casting (see page 87). If the casting strike the original target.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 159
The wicked jar;Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Sun;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This spell changes a demon with Might no greater than (the level of this spell – 10) so that it is bound to a physical object, usually a hollowed jar or pot made of clay and sealed. The effect is similar to the Goetic Art of Binding: the demon becomes part of the object for as long as the spell is active, and is only released if the object is broken or the effect ends.This effect is usually imbued into a device with a lesser enchantment, designed to operate constantly, so that the effect can theoretically last forever. It is often made with many uses per day, which allows multiple demons to be held at once.;Realms of Power – The Infernal, 122

A Wizard’s Boost may never affect a single spell more than once. There are ten versions of this spell, one for each Hermetic Form. There are other versions of this spell, each of which affects one of range, duration, and target, for any Form. This does not allow spontaneous or formulaic spells to reach Year duration or Boundary Target, unless the Wizard’s Boost is a ritual.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 160
Wizard’s communion;Mu;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Mom;Group;"";effect);"";This spell lets magi combine their power to cast spells. The group of magi work together to cast a specified spell through the unified power of the Communion. Only one extra magus may join the Communion for each 5 levels of the specified spell being cast. One of the magi in the group must also know the specified spell, or castit from a Casting Tablet. Only one magus in the group needs to cast the spell. The magus who casts the Wizard’s Communion need not be the one who casts the main spell, and normally it is better for them to be different. More than one magus in the group may cast the spell. In this case, add the total levels of successfully cast Wizard’s Communion to get the effective level of the Wizard’s Communion for this casting. This combined total must be at least twice the level of the specified spell being cast. One magus must roll for success as if casting the specified spell himself. However, the target number for the spellcasting roll is the spell’s level divided by the number of magi participating in the Communion. So if five magi participate to cast a 50th level spell, the caster would have to successfully cast a 10th level spell — with all the relevant requisites, of course. This method of casting adds one botch die per magus participating. If the spell botches, all participants gain Warping Points and thus must check for Twilight. Communion is a remnant of Mercurian rituals, so spontaneous spells may not be cast by this means, and it does not perfectly fit into the guidelines of Hermetic theory.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 160

This is an extremely painful and emotionally scarring experience for both parties. After the cords have been cut, both magus and former familiar find each other’s presence too much to bear.

Impede the impertinent interloper;Pe;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Ring;Circle;"";effect;+1 Touch, +2 Ring;This spell cancels the casting of any spell of instant transportation within a circle drawn at the time of casting, or to a person within the circle. It also prevents the area within the circle from being the destination of such a spell. The spell fails and the intended target does not move. The spell can only cancel spells of a level less than the (level of this spell + 5 + stress die (no botch)). Thus a 25th level version of this spell is always sufficient to block a Seven-League Stride, and might block The Leap of Homecoming if the stress die result is 5 or more.

The Aegis of the Hearth effect must be less than the level of the Removing the Keystone spell + 3 magnitudes + stress die. This spell must penetrate the Aegis of the Hearth effect, of course.Note that if the Aegis of the Hearth is of a high level, then this spell may need to be a ritual.;Hermetic Projects, 94
Revoke the protection of bonisagus;Pe;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice;"This spell disrupts the Parma Magica, a specific type of Hermetic magic. This spell must Penetrate the target’s Vim-based Magic Resistance, and it must have a total of (level + 10 + stress die) that is greater than the target’s Parma Magica x 5. The affected magus is still protected by the Magic Resistance provided by his Forms, but must repeat the Parma Magica ritual to restore his full Magic Resistance. The School of Raghallach uses this spell in Wizard War or during a Wizard’s March. Outside of these situations, using this spell against a conscious magus could be construed as the prelude to an attempt to slay a magus; some Tribunals have ruled that the caster forfeits immunity by doing so. Many Tribunals (including Hibernia) have forbidden the creation of enchantments containing this effect that have neither restricted users nor effect expiry, for fear of it getting into the wrong hands.";The Contested Isle – The Hibernian Tribunal, 62
Revoke the protection of (form);Pe;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Diam;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice, +1 Diam;There are ten versions of this spell, one for each Hermetic Form (see New Guidelines). If the target has Form Resistance aligned to the appropriate Form that is less than or equal to (spell level – 5 + stress die), then the Form Resistance is canceled for the spell’s Duration. Form Resistance automatically reasserts itself once the spell ends. This spell must Penetrate the Vim-based Magic Resistance of the target to take effect. This spell carries similar legal implications to Revoke the Protection of Bonisagus.;The Contested Isle – The Hibernian Tribunal, 62
Revoke the protection of (realm);Pe;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Diam;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice, +1 Diam;There are four versions of this spell, one for each supernatural Realm (see New Guidelines). If the target has a Might Score from that Realm that is less than or equal to (spell level + 5 + stress die), then its Magic Resistance is canceled for the spell’s Duration, reasserting itself when the spell expires. Might Score is otherwise unaffected. This spell must Penetrate the Vim-based Magic Resistance of the target to take effect. This spell is typically used when the caster wants to affect a supernatural creature with a beneficial spell, or subdue but not harm it.;The Contested Isle – The Hibernian Tribunal, 62

Wind of mundane silence;Pe;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Mom;Room;"";effect;+2 Voice, +2 Room;You raise a metaphorical “breeze” that blows the magic away from an area, canceling the effects of any spell there. You can cancel the effects of any spell if, with this spell, you can double the level of the spell on a stress die + the level of your spell. The spell must penetrate to affect effects on a creature with Magic Resistance, including Parma Magica. If the spell penetrates, and its level + the stress die is double Parma Magica x 5, then this spell dispels the Parma Magica. Wind of Mundane Silence does not affect spells of Momentary duration. Magical things near the area of the Wind wave slightly from the “breeze.”;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 161
Lash of the chastened servant;Pe;Vi;"";"5";Voice;Sun;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice;This spell, if it penetrates Magic Resistance, removes 5 Might Points from a demon. This is a painful experience, and can be used to force compliance much as one would when whipping a recalcitrant animal. It is therefore one of the more dangerous spells to be known by a member of the Order, and incurs heavy suspicion of diabolism.;Realms of Power – The Infernal, 122
Nails of iron;Pe;Vi;"";"5";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"4";+1 Touch;The touch of the caster tears at the fabric of stories. The target faerie is weakened and loses 10 Might Score. This must Penetrate the faerie’s Magic Resistance. If the faerie is reduced to 0 Might it is destroyed.Note that this spell is of little use in a Wizard’s War. However, it is a good way to attack a faerie if the magus has discovered an Arcane Connection to it (and can therefore open an Intangible Tunnel to the faerie). Similar spells can be used to attack creatures of other realms.;Hermetic Projects, 84
Break the shield;Pe;Vi;"";"10";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch;This spell dispels the Parma Magica of the target. The target’s Parma Magica Score must be less than (25 + stress die) divided by 5. The target can, of course, recast his Parma Magica in subsequent rounds, but the target may not notice that his Parma Magic has been dispelled until it is too late.Obviously, this spell is only really useful for attacking other magi. Thus, some tribunals may view magi who are known to have invented this spell with suspicion. On the other hand, there are legitimate reasons for knowing this spell — prosecuting Wizard’s War and hunting Marched magi are entirely legal and uncontroversial pursuits.Like all spells, this spell must Penetrate to be effective.Higher-level versions of this are possible for attacking targets with greater Parma Magica scores.Note that this spell uses the Perdo Vim guideline, which dispels magic effects of a specific type (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 160). Parma Magica is an example of a magical effect of a specific type, which all Hermetic magi are familiar with. This is why Wind of Mundane Silence (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 161), which dispels all magical effects is effective against Parma Magica. This spell does not dispel Magic Resistance generated via other sources, nor is this spell effective against any other sorts of magic.;Hermetic Projects, 85
Chastise the unruly fiend;Pe;Vi;"";"10";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice, free cosmetic effect;The effect of this reinvented spell is practically equivalent to The Demon’s Eternal Oblivion, though its cosmetic component makes it appear somewhat differently.A black tentacle, similar to a writhing whip, lashes out from the caster’s palm to hit the targeted Infernal creature, reducing its Infernal Might score by 10 points. Brought close to destruction, a demon can be punished, and forced to obey, or at least to take the caster seriously. Note that the caster must be able to perceive or sense a demon to target it, and the spell must penetrate its Magic Resistance to take effect.;Magi of Hermes, 133

The evocation does not hinder the movement or senses of the target in any way, but merely affects all magic that is cast. Note that this spell must be fast cast if it is supposed to take effect before the opponent can act in the first round. (See Ars Magica Fifth Edition, pages 83 and 87.)In Tolides’ version of the spell, it appears as if the target is trapped in a dark cocoon of semi-transparent, wildly writhing vapor.;Magi of Hermes, 134

Sever the connection;Pe;Vi;"";"20";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch;The targeted Arcane Connection has its duration reduced by three magnitudes.

The affected item can then be stored for a couple of weeks before being passed on.;Transforming Mythic Europe, 129
Breaking the shield;Pe;Vi;"";"25";Sight;Mom;Ind;"";effect;+3 Sight;This spell is designed to permanently cancel an existing Aegis of the Hearth ritual with a level less than 30 (i.e. the level of this spell +1 magnitude) + a Stress Die, bringing its magical protection to an abrupt end.As this spell is cast against an Aegis, the effect must first penetrate the level of that Aegis. This version of the spell has been designed to tear down at least a sixth magnitude Aegis, and so must penetrate a resistance of at least 30. To help with this feat, Al-’Aqrab has taught versions of the Wizards Communion spell to the other magi in his new covenant, which helps them to cast their spells and Rituals at sufficiently high level and penetration.Casting this spell requires that Al-‘Aqrab be within sight of the target’s boundary, though of course the Aegis itself does not need to be made visible.;Tales of Power, 126
Stripping the superfluous realities;Pe;Vi;Muto;"30";Touch;Mom;Bound;Ritual;"4";+1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +1 Muto requisite;An inverse variant of Stratifying the Subtle Realities, this spell causes an immediate roll on the Aura Weakening Table for the Magic regio in which it is cast, with a modifier equal to 0, but treating a roll of 2 as a 0 and adding five to the number of botch dice for this roll and for subsequent yearly rolls. If a botch results then the desired effect occurs, which is that the regio level in which it is cast is destroyed. Even if this spell does not immediately remove the targeted regio level, the extra botch dice for subsequent rolls in following years might cause it to later vanish. Depending on the outcome of the roll, this spell might have the (probably) unwanted side effect of weakening the aura instead. If the casting of this spell is botched, suitable outcomes might be to roll as above, but on the Aura Strengthening Table instead, to inadvertently destroy the wrong regio level, or to otherwise corrupt the structure of the regio.;Realms of Power – Magic, 14

It creates a magical conduit between the magus and the demon using the demon’s True Name (which is essential for this spell), and the demon is compelled to travel almost instantly to the magus’s location through that conduit. If the magus has prepared an arcane circle, such as in the spell Ward Against Demons, he can force the demon to appear within it.;Realms of Power – The Infernal, 122
Aegis of the hearth;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Year;Bound;Ritual;effect);"";This ritual protects a covenant in the way a Parma Magica protects a magus.If any spell is cast toward the Aegis (originating from outside it) by any magus who was not involved in the Aegis ritual, the Aegis resists the spell. Furthermore, spells that bring objects into the Aegis, including teleportation spells such as The Seven-League Stride, are also resisted unless the caster was involved in the ritual. If the foreign spell cannot penetrate a resistance equal to the level of the Aegis, it fizzles out. The Aegis is also able to block foreign Intellego spells, even if they cannot normally be blocked by a Parma Magica, and spells that were cast before they entered the Aegis, such as an invisibility spell cast on a magus outside the Aegis.Magi who were not involved in the ritual and who cast spells within the Aegis must subtract half the level of the Aegis from all their Casting Totals. Spells successfully cast have otherwise normal effects (e.g. Ignem spells still do full damage). Penetration totals for magical creatures are reduced by the same amount.Effects from enchanted devices are resisted by the Aegis unless the item was within the Aegis at the time of casting, or was created within the Aegis by someone who was part of the ritual or in possession of a token.Creatures with a Might score cannot enter the area protected by the Aegis unless they have a higher Might than the Aegis’s level. When approaching the border of an Aegis, a magical person (including a Hermetic magus) feels a slight tingle in the extremities. Magical, Infernal, Faerie, and Divine creatures and persons may be brought within the Aegis, if they are formally invited by one who participated in its casting and given a token to represent the invitation. (The tokens are used during the casting of the ritual, and thus conform to the Law of Sympathy.) Such a person is also not affected by the penalty to casting within the Aegis. The invitation may be withdrawn at any time. This does not require retrieving the token or even notifying the individual who is no longer welcome. Withdrawing an invitation will not expel the person beyond the Aegis, but will prevent them from re-entering after they leave (unless their Might is high enough), and subject them to the Casting Total penalty while they are within the Aegis. The invitation and expulsion must both be issued by magi who participated in the ritual, but not necessarily by the same magus. A magus may only invite or expel specific, known, individuals. He may not expel someone he does not know has been invited in.The Aegis is typically cast on the winter solstice, since magical auras can be slightly higher at that time, and the Aegis then lasts for the entire next year. The entire covenant usually participates in theAegis ritual, which often ends with the participants walking around the perimeter of the protected area in order to define it. Quite often, the covenant holds a major council meeting, or perhaps a large feast, after the ritual of the Aegis. Magi do not need to be able to cast the spell to participate in the ritual, and, indeed, non- Hermetic wizards can participate as well. Only one magus needs to actually cast the spell.Aegis of the Hearth was invented by Notatus, the first Primus of House Bonisagus. It was a major breakthrough, incorporating Mercurian rituals as well as Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was chosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is more powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo requisite. By 1220 Notatus’s discoveries have spread, and any magus trained in the Order is capable of inventing versions of the Aegis with the above parameters, but at different levels. Inventing a version with different parameters, however, would require a similar breakthrough, and years of research.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 161
Arcane seal;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Sun;Ind;"";effect;+1 Touch, + 2 Sun;This spell can be cast on a magical tunnel created by an Intangible Tunnel-style of effect, but it may only be cast by the magus who originally cast the Intangible Tunnel effect, because this spell uses the “suppress own spell” guideline (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 161).The tunnel is sealed for the duration of this spell, and spells can no longer be cast through the tunnel in either direction.When this spell expires, or it is ended some other way, the tunnel may be used again (if it has not expired in the meantime). This spell may be used to seal Intangible Tunnel type effects of a level up to one magnitude less than this spell. The seal itself appears as a Hermetic sigil emblazoned in the air.Note that the seal itself is a spell, and so can be dispelled. However, the seal is only present at the caster’s end of the Intangible Tunnel. There is nothing to dispel at the other end.;Hermetic Projects, 81
Break the siege;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Sun;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice, +2 Sun;This spell suppresses a magical tunnel created by Hermetic Vim magic, if the level of the magical tunnel creating spell is less than or equal to half the level of this spell + 1 magnitude. For the duration of this spell, spells can no longer be cast through the tunnel, in either direction. When this spell expires, or it is ended some other way, the tunnel may be used again (if it has not expired in the meantime).It is a good idea to master this spell taking the Fast Casting mastery (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 87).This spell can be cast at either end of the magical tunnel. However, note that, without the aid of magical senses, only the original caster of the magical tunnel can target it. Of course, the Break the Siege effect is a spell, and can be dispelled itself. However, the Break the Siege spell is only present at the end which it was cast at. There is nothing to dispel at the other end.;Hermetic Projects, 81
Circular ward against demons;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Ring;Circle;"";spell);"";All creatures with Infernal Might equal to or less than the level of the spell are unable to enter the circle or harm those within it. If you cast the spell again, the stronger ring dispels the weaker, regardless of the order of casting. Some magi cast this spell before going to sleep at night. At night, from certain angles, the ring may be seen as a silver-hued dome.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 162

The Aegis of the Hearth effect must be less than half the level of this spell + 3 magnitudes. The known Lab Texts of this spell incorporate a side effect: while the Aegis of the Hearth is lowered, the temperature within the affected boundary is lowered slightly, which sensitive characters might notice.This spell must penetrate the Aegis of the Hearth effect, of course. Note that if the Aegis of the Hearth is of a high level, then this spell may need to be a ritual.;Hermetic Projects, 94
Invoke the pact of zelos;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Arc;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"";"";This spell represents the formation of a pact with Zelos, the Daimon of rivalry and contention. It targets a duplicate (called an Aspect) of Zelos, rather than the spirit itself, and if the spell penetrates the Aspect’s Might (see insert), that Aspect appears before the caster to perform a specific service. This spell does not exert any control over this spirit.Without the Mystery Virtue of Hermetic Theurgy, this spell must have a level of at least 40 (twice the Might of the Daimon’s Aspect), and it usually needs to be cast using Wizard’s Communion, to achieve sufficient Penetration. As a spell adapted from non-Hermetic theurgic practices, it requires knowledge of a Mystery, or a Hermetic Breakthrough, to invent, although nontheurgist Hermetic magi can learn the spell from a Lab Text or from a teacher. Acquiring an Arcane Connection to a Daimon such as Zelos is no simple task, and may be the focus of a story in its own right.(General effect, +4 Arcane Connection, see The Mysteries Revised Edition, Chapter 9: Hermetic Theurgy for more details);Houses of Hermes – Societates, 100
Maintaining the demanding spell;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Diam;Ind;"";effect;+1 Touch, +1 Diam;You cast this spell on a spell that you have already cast and are maintaining through concentration. The spell that requires concentration is then automatically maintained for the duration of this spell, whether you concentrate or not. You cannot change the effects of the first spell without concentrating on it again. For instance, you can use The Unseen Arm (ReTe 5) to hold an object in the air without concentrating, but to move the object still requires concentration. A Stamina + Concentration stress roll of 6+ must be made in order to cast this spell while keeping the first one going (a lower roll than normal because this is what the spell is designed for). This spell only works on spells of equal or lower level.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 162
Opening the intangible tunnel;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Arc;Conc;Ind;"";effect;+4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration;You can open a magical channel from yourself to some target, allowing you to cast any spell with a range greater than Personal on that target. The tunnel does not, of itself, grant any sense impressions of the target — you must cast appropriate spells through it if you wish to see. Spells cast through the tunnel cannot be of higher level than that of this spell. You must make standard Concentration rolls to maintain concentration on the Opening spell as you cast other spells.A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through The Invisible Eye Revealed or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the tunneling spell.If the target of the spell has Magic Resistance, you must penetrate that resistance to open the tunnel. Spells cast through the tunnel must also penetrate Magic Resistance normally.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 162
Quiet the cursing tongue;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Voice;Sun;Ind;"";effect;+2 Voice, +2 Sun;The target of this spell cannot use any curse magic with a level less than or equal to (spell level – 10).

This spell can be used as a template for spells that affect other types of exotic magic.;Houses of Hermes – Societates, 129
Suppressing the wizard’s handiwork;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Conc;Ind;"";"";"";Cancels one spell that you have cast, but only as long as you concentrate. When concentration is broken the effects of the spell return. The level of the spell to be suppressed must not exceed the level of this spell. The effects of the spell being suppressed take about one round to fade out, and then another round to return after concentration is broken. The spell to be affected must be active to be suppressed — in particular, it may not be of Momentary duration.Common uses of this spell include providing access to some place normally blocked by magic (for example, having a MuTe blocking the door to your lab, and then suppressing it to enter), and avoiding traps (such as suppressing a Watching Ward [ReVi Gen] on your rear door). This spell is designed to be held while you do something else, so the magus gets a +3 bonus to all Concentration rolls.(Base, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration);Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 162

This spell opens a tunnel between the magus and any target within Sight Range.The advantage of this is that it lowers the effective range between the magus and the target — which means that lower magnitude effects can be used on the target, which should increase the effective Penetration Total.Effects cast through The Evil Eye tunnel can be up to one magnitude greater than the magnitude of The Evil Eye spell.;Hermetic Projects, 80
The master’s message;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Moon;Ind;"";"";"";This spell opens a tunnel between the magus and a character that he touches.Once it is cast, the tunnel remains in place, even if the characters break contact. The purpose of this spell is to enable the magus to open a tunnel between himself and a grog. The grog can then depart on a mission, and the magus is able to monitor his progressand cast spells through the tunnel as required.Even if the grog character has no Magic Resistance, it is a good idea to record the Penetration of this spell, as the grog may try to pass through a hostile Aegis.Effects cast through The Master’s Message tunnel can be up to one magnitude greater than the magnitude of The Master’s Message spell.

The patient spell;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Conc;Ind;"";effect;+1 Touch, + 1 Concentration;"When this spell is cast in conjunction with a second spell (requiring an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9), the other spell is delayed in taking effect until the caster ceases concentration on The Patient Spell. The target spell can be no higher than the level +15 of The Patient Spell. A spell held using The Patient Spell may be released to interrupt an action in the same manner as a fast cast spell, requiring the same “fast casting” roll of Quickness + Finesse (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 83).Ranulf uses The Patient Spell to provide himself with an opportunity to cast Boreal Flames with Pilum of Fire. Maintaining concentration on The Patient Spell while casting another spell requires an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to perform successfully; this is easier than normal, because the spell is designed for this use.";Magi of Hermes, 113

Watching ward;Re;Vi;"";Gen;Touch;Spec;Ind;Ritual;effect;+1 Touch, Duration is nonstandard;Watching Ward puts another spell on a given target on hold until that spell is triggered by a simple condition, which is determined when this ritual is cast. The target of the Watching Ward must be present for the entire casting ritual. When the conditions you specify come to pass, the suspended spell takes effect.Only one Watching Ward can be placed on any one person or object. The level of the Watching Ward must at least equal the level of the spell held in suspension. You can put multiple spells in the Ward,provided that its level at least equals the sum of the levels of the contained spells. If Intellego spells are included in a Watching Ward, they may be used to trigger the other spells. Thus, if you put Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie (InMe 20) into the Watching Ward, you can also put in a spell that is cast when someone lies. An Intellego spell in the Watching Ward has no effect other than to cast other spells when the proper condition is detected. Thus, in the example, one’s breath is not frosty when he or she is caught in a lie.If someone tries to dispel the Watching Ward and fails, the suspended spell is cast. Flambeau and Tytalus magi commonly put highly destructive spells upon their persons, to be cast if they die so they may have vengeance upon their killers. The Ritual nature of this spell supports the potentially indefinite duration.The Watching Ward is dispelled when it releases its spell. A version of this spell with target Room, known as Waiting Spell, is also well known in the Order. It can contain spells up to the level of the Waiting Spell – 10, and is also a Ritual.;Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 162

Faeries with Might greater than the spell’s level are not restrained by this spell, nor are faeries that resist the spell’s Penetration.Lambert’s version of this spell was developed from laboratory notes made by a Merinita magus with the virtue of Spell Potency (The Mysteries Revised Edition page 31 or Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults page 6) concerning faeries. Lambert is unable to cast this spell unless he wraps an iron chain around the protected item at the time of the casting. Due to the influence of the iron chain, this spell is cast with a Potency Bonus of +7.Lambert finds that faeries rarely confront him about his use of this spell when he casts it on goods that he brings into their lands, but they become exceedingly displeased by the spell when it is used upon any item that is native to their home.;Magi of Hermes, 68
Cleanse the verminous vis;Re;Vi;"";"15";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch;This spell is used to make vis of Infernal provenance safe for use by a Hermetic magus. It transfers the vis from its original physical form into a item of the magus’s choosing, which is touched to the original vis. This item must be of sufficient shape and material (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 97) to be able to contain the vis transferred into it. However, this spell does not operate quite how the Venatores think that it does: vis which is heavily corrupted by the Infernal still contains a measure of its taint. Vis prava becomesvis sordida, vis sordida becomes vis infesta, and only vis infesta becomes normal vis (see Chapter 1: The Infernal Realm, Infernal Vis in Realms of Power – The Infernal). Note that casting this spell also incurs the extra botch dice inherent in handling Infernal vis, even though the Infernal vis is not consumed in its casting.;Realms of Power – The Infernal, 122
Distillation of the purest stream;Re;Vi;"";"15";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"10";+1 Touch;Concentrates the essence of a stream of exceptionally pure water into a pawn of Aquam vis. The purity of the stream determines how often the spell may be cast successfully upon it.;Covenants, 77
Gather the essence of the beast;Re;Vi;"";"15";Touch;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+1 Touch+2 Voice, +1 Concentration;Concentrates the raw vis in a corpse into one part of that corpse, which can then be removed. This spell lets you gather all the raw vis you find without lugging around entire corpses of beasts. Note that the vis in many magical creatures is already concentrated in this manner in some specific organ, though this spell will allow you to relocate that vis if you wish.commAnd the VIle spIrItReVi 20R: Voice, D: Conc, T: IndThe caster may force a demon to obey his commands, through intimidation and the power of his will. If the spell penetrates the creature’s Magic Resistance, make a Communication + Leadership roll, adding the caster’s Hierarchy Score as a bonus. The storyguide subtracts the demon’s Hierarchy Score and uses the total to determine the strength of the effect, though anything other than a botch always produces at least minimal results.;Realms of Power – The Infernal, 122
Swift wings of timeless days;Re;Vi;"";"20";Per;Mom;Ind;"";"20)";"";The length of the caster’s journey through the Twilight Void is reduced by three steps from his initial Speed Level. With a Speed Level of 6 the caster would return to the Magic Realm after a year, and this spell would increase his Speed Level to 18, meaning that he emerges after only a day.;Realms of Power – Magic, 28
Divide the gathered essence;Re;Vi;"";"25";Touch;Mom;Group;"";"10";+1 Touch, +2 Group;Transfers the raw vis from an item into one or more containers. The maga may freely choose how the vis is to be divided.;The Mysteries, 40
A day’s grace;Re;Vi;"";"30";Touch;Hours;Ind;"";"15";+1 Touch, +2 Hours - equivalent of Sun;Using this spell, the caster is able to suppress one other spell he casts at the same time as this spell for a Duration counted in Celestial Hours (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 49).The suppressed spell can have a level up to 25 and may be Spontaneous, Ceremonial or Formulaic. Ritual spells are too complex to be suppressed by this spell although should a version of this spell be designed as a Ritual that should be possible.Spells with Circle and/or Ring Duration (including Arcane Circle and Arcane Ring) are also suppressed but fail if the circle inscribed during casting is broken before the spell is released (Arcane Circles and Rings are still visible to those with Second Sight, and may be broken by them before the spell is released).Sight-Ranged spells must be targeted during the initial casting. Once the spell has been cast, the target will still be affected by it whether or not that target is still visible to the caster or not, though only where that target remains in the same location until the spell is triggered.;Magi of Hermes, 102
Subsume the apparent dominion;Re;Vi;"";"50";Touch;Year;Room;Ritual;"15";+1 Touch, +4 Year, +2 Room;This spell allows a subsumed aura to manifest by temporarily suppressing an apparent Dominion aura of strength less than or equal to three. It has a Room Target and so produces a localized effect, ideal for mimicking a weak lacuna. If there are any other auras present, the strongest of these manifests.Casting this ritual creates a preternatural tether of level one and provides a +1 yearly aura modifier, both as described in Realms of Power: Magic, page 10.This laboratory text is for a level 50 ritual but the effect is general. By re-creating the spell from this laboratory text, the maga accumulates 10 points towards researching Confluence of the Realms (see Legends of Hermes). To do this, Conciatta’s own code must first be broken (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 102), which requires at least a season working with the text to decode it. The only available casting tablet for this spell is the one written into the cellar fresco.;Legends of Hermes, 26

This influences the individual’s most prominent humor, which increases the individual’s strongest Personality Trait by 3 points and grants a new +3 Personality Trait for the spell’s duration according to the character’s dominant humor.Sanguine HystericCholeric PsychoticMelancholic NeuroticPhlegmatic Fearful;Dies Irae, 40
The fall;Cr;Ae;"";"35";Voice;Mom;Ind;"";"5";+4 for density of stone, +2 Voice;Creates an amount of aether with the density of earth that travels 50 paces in an arc during the round in which the spell is cast. If this aether is aimed at an individual, a Perception + Finesse roll is made against the target’s Defense roll. If successful, the target takes +30 damage.the unseen bArrIerCrAe 35R: Touch, D: Conc, T: IndividualThis spell creates a wall of aether, anchored to the ground, in an arc described by the caster. The wall has the density of tightly-packed earth and is four paces wide, by two paces tall, and about one pace thick, enough to arrest the charge of any assailants or projectiles. Like all aether, the wall itself is invisible, but it does give off a glow. (Base 25, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration)Intellego Aethera;Dies Irae, 40

Aetheric fire;Mu;Ae;Ignem;"35";Sight;Conc;Ind;"";"10";+3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +1 intensity;This spell gives the target intangible aether the unnatural quality of heat. The default quality makes the aether noticeably warm, but does no damage. However, this effect increases the intensity of the heat such that it does +10 damage to those within the area of effect.This effect has a number of advantages over the much lower level equivalent CrIg effect. First, the aetheric fire cannot itself be affected by non-aetheric effects, second if the aether is intangible it can pass through physical barriers in its way, and third those caught in the fire do not benefit from any Ignem Form bonus they might possess.Perdo Aethera;Dies Irae, 42
Hold the sky in thrall;Pe;Ae;"";"145";Sight;Mom;Ind;Ritual;"5";+3 Sight, +5 density, +20 size;This ritual destroys the target aether’s fundamental property of movement. Upon completion of the ritual, the effect is instant and irrevocable.This ritual, given the nature of the power concerned, is unique. It has been designed to target the moon, or rather the aether behind what those below the Lunar Sphere perceive as the moon. Once cast, there is no other target that this ritual can then target.Rego Aethera;Dies Irae, 31
